This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary."

Or you can use a site like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to find books that are available online.  You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.\n",

Run the following cell to perform all the installs and imports for your word cloud script and uploader widget.  It may take a minute for all of this to run and there will be a lot of output messages. But, be patient. Once you get the following final line of output, the code is done executing. Then you can continue on with the rest of the instructions for this notebook.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. The Science of Architecture, followed out to its full extent, is one\r\n",
      "of the noblest of those which have reference only to the creations of\r\n",
      "human minds. It is not merely a science of the rule and compass, it does\r\n",
      "not consist only in the observation of just rule, or of fair proportion:\r\n",
      "it is, or ought to be, a science of feeling more than of rule, a\r\n",
      "ministry to the mind, more than to the eye. If we consider how much less\r\n",
      "the beauty and majesty of a building depend upon its pleasing certain\r\n",
      "prejudices of the eye, than upon its rousing certain trains of\r\n",
      "meditation in the mind, it will show in a moment how many intricate\r\n",
      "questions of feeling are involved in the raising of an edifice; it will\r\n",
      "convince us of the truth of a proposition, which might at first have\r\n",
      "appeared startling, that no man can be an architect, who is not a\r\n",
      "metaphysician.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. To the illustration of the department of this noble science which may\r\n",
      "be designated the Poetry of Architecture, this and some future articles\r\n",
      "will be dedicated. It is this peculiarity of the art which constitutes\r\n",
      "its nationality; and it will be found as interesting as it is useful, to\r\n",
      "trace in the distinctive characters of the architecture of nations, not\r\n",
      "only its adaptation to the situation and climate in which it has arisen,\r\n",
      "but its strong similarity to, and connection with, the prevailing turn\r\n",
      "of mind by which the nation who first employed it is distinguished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. I consider the task I have imposed upon myself the more necessary,\r\n",
      "because this department of the science, perhaps regarded by some who\r\n",
      "have no ideas beyond stone and mortar as chimerical, and by others who\r\n",
      "think nothing necessary but truth and proportion as useless, is at a\r\n",
      "miserably low ebb in England. And what is the consequence? We have\r\n",
      "Corinthian columns placed beside pilasters of no order at all,\r\n",
      "surmounted by monstrosified pepper-boxes, Gothic in form and Grecian in\r\n",
      "detail, in a building nominally and peculiarly \"National\"; we have Swiss\r\n",
      "cottages, falsely and calumniously so entitled, dropped in the\r\n",
      "brick-fields round the metropolis; and we have staring square-windowed,\r\n",
      "flat-roofed gentlemen's seats, of the lath and plaster,\r\n",
      "mock-magnificent, Regent's Park description, rising on the woody\r\n",
      "promontories of Derwentwater.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. How deeply is it to be regretted, how much is it to be wondered at,\r\n",
      "that, in a country whose school of painting, though degraded by its\r\n",
      "system of meretricious coloring, and disgraced by hosts of would-be\r\n",
      "imitators of inimitable individuals, is yet raised by the distinguished\r\n",
      "talent of those individuals to a place of well-deserved honor; and the\r\n",
      "studios of whose sculptors are filled with designs of the most pure\r\n",
      "simplicity, and most perfect animation; the school of architecture\r\n",
      "should be so miserably debased!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5. There are, however, many reasons for a fact so lamentable. In the\r\n",
      "first place, the patrons of architecture (I am speaking of all classes\r\n",
      "of buildings, from the lowest to the highest), are a more numerous and\r\n",
      "less capable class than those of painting. The general public, and I say\r\n",
      "it with sorrow, because I know it from observation, have little to do\r\n",
      "with the encouragement of the school of painting, beyond the power which\r\n",
      "they unquestionably possess, and unmercifully use, of compelling our\r\n",
      "artists to substitute glare for beauty. Observe the direction of public\r\n",
      "taste at any of our exhibitions. We see visitors at that of the Society\r\n",
      "of Painters in Water Colors, passing Tayler with anathemas and Lewis\r\n",
      "with indifference, to remain in reverence and admiration before certain\r\n",
      "amiable white lambs and water-lilies, whose artists shall be nameless.\r\n",
      "We see them, in the Royal Academy, passing by Wilkie, Turner and\r\n",
      "Callcott, with shrugs of doubt or of scorn, to fix in gazing and\r\n",
      "enthusiastic crowds upon kettles-full of witches, and His Majesty's\r\n",
      "ships so and so lying to in a gale, etc., etc. But these pictures attain\r\n",
      "no celebrity because the public admire them, for it is not to the public\r\n",
      "that the judgment is intrusted. It is by the chosen few, by our nobility\r\n",
      "and men of taste and talent, that the decision is made, the fame\r\n",
      "bestowed, and the artist encouraged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "6. Not so in architecture. There, the power is generally diffused. Every\r\n",
      "citizen may box himself up in as barbarous a tenement as suits his taste\r\n",
      "or inclination; the architect is his vassal, and must permit him not\r\n",
      "only to criticise, but to perpetrate. The palace or the nobleman's seat\r\n",
      "may be raised in good taste, and become the admiration of a nation; but\r\n",
      "the influence of their owner is terminated by the boundary of his\r\n",
      "estate: he has no command over the adjacent scenery, and the possessor\r\n",
      "of every thirty acres around him has him at his mercy. The streets of\r\n",
      "our cities are examples of the effects of this clashing of different\r\n",
      "tastes; and they are either remarkable for the utter absence of all\r\n",
      "attempt at embellishment, or disgraced by every variety of abomination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "7. Again, in a climate like ours, those few who have knowledge and\r\n",
      "feeling to distinguish what is beautiful, are frequently prevented by\r\n",
      "various circumstances from erecting it. John Bull's comfort perpetually\r\n",
      "interferes with his good taste, and I should be the first to lament his\r\n",
      "losing so much of his nationality, as to permit the latter to prevail.\r\n",
      "He cannot put his windows into a recess, without darkening his rooms; he\r\n",
      "cannot raise a narrow gable above his walls, without knocking his head\r\n",
      "against the rafters; and, worst of all, he cannot do either, without\r\n",
      "being stigmatized by the awful, inevitable epithet, of \"a very odd man.\"\r\n",
      "But, though much of the degradation of our present school of\r\n",
      "architecture is owing to the want or the unfitness of patrons, surely it\r\n",
      "is yet more attributable to a lamentable deficiency of taste and talent\r\n",
      "among our architects themselves. It is true, that in a country affording\r\n",
      "so little encouragement, and presenting so many causes for its absence,\r\n",
      "it cannot be expected that we should have any Michael Angelo\r\n",
      "Buonarottis. The energy of our architects is expended in raising \"neat\"\r\n",
      "poor-houses, and \"pretty\" charity schools; and, if they ever enter upon\r\n",
      "a work of higher rank, economy is the order of the day: plaster and\r\n",
      "stucco are substituted for granite and marble; rods of splashed iron for\r\n",
      "columns of verd-antique; and in the wild struggle after novelty, the\r\n",
      "fantastic is mistaken for the graceful, the complicated for the\r\n",

      "beauty of natural scenery, those are the most effective which can give\r\n",
      "animation to the scene, while the spirit which they bestow is in unison\r\n",

      "such existence as shall be imbued with the spirit, and shall partake of\r\n",
      "the essence, of the beauty, which, without it, would be dead. If our\r\n",
      "object, therefore, is to embellish a scene the character of which is\r\n",
      "peaceful and unpretending, we must not erect a building fit for the\r\n",

      "an object immediately indicates the presence of a kind of existence\r\n",
      "unsuited to the scenery which it inhabits; and of a mind which, when it\r\n",
      "sought retirement, was unacquainted with its own ruling feelings, and\r\n",

      "down, and mathematically leveled at the edges; and, though the martin is\r\n",
      "permitted to attach his humble domicile, in undisturbed security, to the\r\n",

      "increasing its usefulness, and making it contribute to the comfort of\r\n",
      "more beings than one. The whitewash is stainless, and its rough surface\r\n",
      "catches a side light as brightly as a front one: the luxuriant rose is\r\n",
      "trained gracefully over the window; and the gleaming lattice, divided\r\n",
      "not into heavy squares, but into small pointed diamonds, is thrown half\r\n",
      "open, as is just discovered by its glance among the green leaves of the\r\n",
      "sweetbrier, to admit the breeze, that, as it passes over the flowers,\r\n",
      "becomes full of their fragrance. The light wooden porch breaks the flat\r\n",

      "honeysuckle spread over the low hatch. A few square feet of garden and a\r\n",

      "on the other side, if we can; for it is a difficult matter. There are\r\n",
      "many villages; but such a thing as an isolated cottage is extremely\r\n",

      "perfect want of everything like neatness; and rendered more conspicuous\r\n",

      "appear to the observer like a dark eye. The door has the same character:\r\n",
      "it is also of stone, which is so much broken and disguised as to prevent\r\n",
      "it from giving any idea of strength or stability. The entrance is always\r\n",

      "minutely checkered into fields; we can never see far at a time; and\r\n",

      "shadow the country for hundreds of square miles, without once letting\r\n",

      "the same scale; there are no fences; we can hardly place ourselves in\r\n",
      "any spot where we shall not see for leagues around; and there is a kind\r\n",
      "of comfortless sublimity in the size of every scene. The French cottage,\r\n",
      "therefore, is on the same scale, equally large and desolate looking;\r\n",
      "but we shall see, presently, that it can arouse feelings which, though\r\n",
      "they cannot be said to give it sublimity, yet are of a higher order than\r\n",

      "16. Again, every bit of cultivated ground in England has a finished\r\n",
      "neatness; the fields are all divided by hedges or fences; the fruit\r\n",
      "trees are neatly pruned; the roads beautifully made, etc. Everything is\r\n",

      "with the countries in which they are found. Let us now see how they\r\n",
      "assimilate with the character of the people by whom they are built.\r\n",
      "England is a country of perpetually increasing prosperity and active\r\n",
      "enterprise; but, for that very reason, nothing is allowed to remain till\r\n",
      "it gets old. Large old trees are cut down for timber; old houses are\r\n",
      "pulled down for the materials; and old furniture is laughed at and\r\n",
      "neglected. Everything is perpetually altered and renewed by the activity\r\n",
      "of invention and improvement. The cottage, consequently, has no\r\n",
      "dilapidated look about it; it is never suffered to get old; it is used\r\n",
      "as long as it is comfortable, and then taken down and rebuilt; for it\r\n",
      "was originally raised in a style incapable of resisting the ravages of\r\n",
      "time. But, in France, there prevail two opposite feelings, both in the\r\n",
      "extreme; that of the old pedigreed population, which preserves\r\n",
      "unlimitedly; and that of the modern revolutionists, which destroys\r\n",
      "unmercifully. Every object has partly the appearance of having been\r\n",
      "preserved with infinite care from an indefinite age, and partly exhibits\r\n",
      "the evidence of recent ill-treatment and disfiguration. Primeval forests\r\n",
      "rear their vast trunks over those of many younger generations growing up\r\n",
      "beside them; the château or the palace, showing, by its style of\r\n",
      "architecture, its venerable age, bears the marks of the cannon-ball,\r\n",
      "and, from neglect, is withering into desolation. Little is renewed:\r\n",
      "there is little spirit of improvement; and the customs which prevailed\r\n",
      "centuries ago are still taught by the patriarchs of the families to\r\n",
      "their grandchildren. The French cottage, therefore, is just such as we\r\n",
      "should have expected from the disposition of its inhabitants; its\r\n",
      "massive windows, its broken ornaments, its whole air and appearance, all\r\n",
      "tell the same tale of venerable age, respected and preserved, till at\r\n",
      "last its dilapidation wears an appearance of neglect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "18. Again, the Englishman will sacrifice everything to comfort, and\r\n",
      "will not only take great pains to secure it, but he has generally also\r\n",
      "the power of doing so: for the English peasant is, on the average,\r\n",
      "wealthier than the French. The French peasant has no idea of comfort,\r\n",
      "and therefore makes no effort to secure it. The difference in the\r\n",
      "character of their inhabitants is, as we have seen, written on the\r\n",
      "fronts of their respective cottages. The Englishman is, also, fond of\r\n",
      "display; but the ornaments, exterior and interior, with which he adorns\r\n",
      "his dwelling, however small it may be, are either to show the extent of\r\n",
      "his possessions, or to contribute to some personal profit or\r\n",
      "gratification: they never seem designed for the sake of ornament alone.\r\n",
      "Thus, his wife's love of display is shown by the rows of useless\r\n",
      "crockery in her cupboard; and his own by the rose tree at the front\r\n",

      "dwelling as much as lies in his power, solely for the gratification of\r\n",
      "his feeling of what is agreeable to the eye. The gable of his roof is\r\n",
      "prettily shaped; the niche at its corner is richly carved; the wooden\r\n",
      "beams, if there be any, are fashioned into grotesque figures; and even\r\n",
      "the \"air négligé\" and general dilapidation of the building tell a\r\n",

      "can be said to be in good taste. On the contrary, when the building is\r\n",
      "of such a class, that it can neither astonish by its beauty, nor impress\r\n",
      "by its sublimity, and when it is likewise placed in a situation so\r\n",
      "uninteresting as to render something more than mere fitness or propriety\r\n",
      "necessary, and to compel the eye to expect something from the building\r\n",
      "itself, a gentle contrast of feeling in that building is exceedingly\r\n",
      "desirable; and if possible, a sense that something has passed away, the\r\n",
      "presence of which would have bestowed a deeper interest on the whole\r\n",
      "scene. The fancy will immediately try to recover this, and, in the\r\n",

      "cannot but be, adapted to this, it is still less able to please by its\r\n",

      "withered, and beauty, which is now faded. This sense of something lost,\r\n",

      "character which these noble shadowy spires can give to her landscape,\r\n",
      "lifting their majestic troops of waving darkness from beside the fallen\r\n",
      "column, or out of the midst of the silence of the shadowed temple and\r\n",

      "footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "25. Every part of the landscape is in unison; the same glory of mourning\r\n",
      "is thrown over the whole; the deep blue of the heavens is mingled with\r\n",
      "that of the everlasting hills, or melted away into the silence of the\r\n",
      "sapphire sea; the pale cities, temple and tower, lie gleaming along the\r\n",
      "champaign; but how calmly! no hum of men; no motion of multitude in the\r\n",
      "midst of them: they are voiceless as the city of ashes. The transparent\r\n",
      "air is gentle among the blossoms of the orange and the dim leaves of the\r\n",
      "olive; and the small fountains, which, in any other land, would spring\r\n",
      "merrily along, sparkling and singing among tinkling pebbles, here flow\r\n",
      "calmly and silently into some pale font of marble, all beautiful with\r\n",
      "life; worked by some unknown hand, long ago nerveless, and fall and\r\n",
      "pass on among wan flowers, and scented copse, through cool leaf-lighted\r\n",
      "caves or gray Egerian grottoes, to join the Tiber or Eridanus, to swell\r\n",
      "the waves of Nemi, or the Larian Lake. The most minute objects (leaf,\r\n",
      "flower, and stone), while they add to the beauty, seem to share in the\r\n",
      "sadness, of the whole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "26. But, if one principal character of Italian landscape is melancholy,\r\n",
      "another is elevation. We have no simple rusticity of scene, no cowslip\r\n",
      "and buttercup humility of seclusion. Tall mulberry trees, with festoons\r\n",
      "of the luxuriant vine, purple with ponderous clusters, trailed and\r\n",
      "trellised between and over them, shade the wide fields of stately Indian\r\n",
      "corn; luxuriance of lofty vegetation (catalpa, and aloe, and olive),\r\n",
      "ranging itself in lines of massy light along the wan champaign, guides\r\n",
      "the eye away to the unfailing wall of mountain, Alp or Apennine; no cold\r\n",
      "long range of shivery gray, but dazzling light of snow, or undulating\r\n",
      "breadth of blue, fainter and darker, in infinite variety; peak,\r\n",
      "precipice, and promontory passing away into the wooded hills, each with\r\n",
      "its tower or white village sloping into the plain; castellated\r\n",
      "battlements cresting their undulations; some wide majestic river gliding\r\n",
      "along the champaign, the bridge on its breast, and the city on its\r\n",
      "shore; the whole canopied with cloudless azure, basking in mistless\r\n",
      "sunshine, breathing the silence of odoriferous air.\r\n",

      "27. Now comes the question. In a country of this pomp of natural glory,\r\n",
      "tempered with melancholy memory of departed pride, what are we to wish\r\n",
      "for, what are we naturally to expect in the character of her most humble\r\n",
      "edifices; those which are most connected with present life--least with\r\n",
      "the past? what are we to consider fitting or beautiful in her cottage?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We do not expect it to be comfortable, when everything around it\r\n",
      "betokens decay and desolation in the works of man. We do not wish it to\r\n",
      "be neat, where nature is most beautiful, because neglected. But we\r\n",
      "naturally look for an elevation of character, a richness of design or\r\n",
      "form, which, while the building is kept a cottage, may yet give it a\r\n",
      "peculiar air of cottage aristocracy; a beauty (no matter how\r\n",
      "dilapidated) which may appear to have been once fitted for the\r\n",
      "surrounding splendor of scene and climate. Now, let us fancy an Italian\r\n",
      "cottage before us. The reader who has traveled in Italy will find little\r\n",
      "difficulty in recalling one to his memory, with its broad lines of light\r\n",
      "and shadow, and its strange, but not unpleasing mixture of grandeur and\r\n",
      "desolation. Let us examine its details, enumerate its architectural\r\n",
      "peculiarities, and see how far it agrees with our preconceived idea of\r\n",
      "what the cottage ought to be?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "28. The first remarkable point of the building is the roof. It generally\r\n",
      "consists of tiles of very deep curvature, which rib it into distinct\r\n",
      "vertical lines, giving it a far more agreeable surface than that of our\r\n",
      "flatter tiling. The _form_ of the roof, however, is always excessively\r\n",
      "flat, so as never to let it intrude upon the eye; and the consequence\r\n",
      "is, that, while an English village, seen at a distance, appears all red\r\n",
      "roof, the Italian is all white wall; and therefore, though always\r\n",
      "bright, is never gaudy. We have in these roofs an excellent example of\r\n",
      "what should always be kept in mind, that everything will be found\r\n",
      "beautiful, which climate or situation render useful. The strong and\r\n",
      "constant heat of the Italian sun would be intolerable if admitted at the\r\n",
      "windows; and, therefore, the edges of the roof project far over the\r\n",
      "walls, and throw long shadows downwards, so as to keep the upper windows\r\n",
      "constantly cool. These long oblique shadows on the white surface are\r\n",
      "always delightful, and are alone sufficient to give the building\r\n",
      "character. They are peculiar to the buildings of Spain and Italy; for\r\n",
      "owing to the general darker color of those of more northerly climates,\r\n",
      "the shadows of their roofs, however far thrown, do not tell distinctly,\r\n",
      "and render them, not varied, but gloomy. Another ornamental use of these\r\n",
      "shadows is, that they break the line of junction of the wall with the\r\n",
      "roof: a point always desirable, and in every kind of building, whether\r\n",
      "we have to do with lead, slate, tile, or thatch, one of extreme\r\n",
      "difficulty. This object is farther forwarded in the Italian cottage, by\r\n",
      "putting two or three windows up under the very eaves themselves, which\r\n",
      "is also done for coolness, so that their tops are formed by the roof;\r\n",
      "and the wall has the appearance of having been terminated by large\r\n",
      "battlements and roofed over. And, finally, the eaves are seldom kept\r\n",
      "long on the same level: double or treble rows of tiling are introduced;\r\n",
      "long sticks and irregular wood-work are occasionally attached to them,\r\n",
      "to assist the festoons of the vine; and the graceful irregularity and\r\n",
      "marked character of the whole must be dwelt on with equal delight by the\r\n",
      "eye of the poet, the artist, or the unprejudiced architect. All,\r\n",
      "however, is exceedingly humble; we have not yet met with the elevation\r\n",
      "of character we expected. We shall find it however as we proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "29. The next point of interest is the window. The modern Italian is\r\n",
      "completely owl-like in his habits. All the daytime he lies idle and\r\n",
      "inert; but during the night he is all activity, but it is mere activity\r\n",
      "of inoccupation. Idleness, partly induced by the temperature of the\r\n",
      "climate, and partly consequent on the decaying prosperity of the nation,\r\n",
      "leaves indications of its influence on all his undertakings. He prefers\r\n",
      "patching up a ruin to building a house; he raises shops and hovels, the\r\n",
      "abodes of inactive, vegetating, brutish poverty, under the protection of\r\n",
      "aged and ruined, yet stalwart, arches of the Roman amphitheater; and the\r\n",
      "habitations of the lower orders frequently present traces of ornament\r\n",
      "and stability of material evidently belonging to the remains of a\r\n",
      "prouder edifice. This is the case sometimes to such a degree as, in\r\n",
      "another country, would be disagreeable from its impropriety; but, in\r\n",
      "Italy, it corresponds with the general prominence of the features of a\r\n",
      "past age, and is always beautiful. Thus, the eye rests with delight on\r\n",
      "the broken moldings of the windows, and the sculptured capitals of the\r\n",
      "corner columns, contrasted, as they are, the one with the glassless\r\n",
      "blackness within, the other with the ragged and dirty confusion of\r\n",
      "drapery around. The Italian window, in general, is a mere hole in the\r\n",
      "thick wall, always well proportioned; occasionally arched at the top,\r\n",
      "sometimes with the addition of a little rich ornament: seldom, if ever,\r\n",
      "having any casement or glass, but filled up with any bit of striped or\r\n",
      "colored cloth, which may have the slightest chance of deceiving the\r\n",
      "distant observer into the belief that it is a legitimate blind. This\r\n",
      "keeps off the sun, and allows a free circulation of air, which is the\r\n",
      "great object. When it is absent, the window becomes a mere black hole,\r\n",
      "having much the same relation to a glazed window that the hollow of a\r\n",
      "skull has to a bright eye; not unexpressive, but frowning and ghastly,\r\n",
      "and giving a disagreeable impression of utter emptiness and desolation\r\n",
      "within. Yet there is character in them: the black dots tell agreeably on\r\n",
      "the walls at a distance, and have no disagreeable sparkle to disturb the\r\n",
      "repose of surrounding scenery. Besides, the temperature renders\r\n",
      "everything agreeable to the eye, which gives it an idea of ventilation.\r\n",
      "A few roughly constructed balconies, projecting from detached windows,\r\n",
      "usually break the uniformity of the wall. In some Italian cottages there\r\n",
      "are wooden galleries, resembling those so frequently seen in\r\n",
      "Switzerland; but this is not a very general character, except in the\r\n",
      "mountain valleys of North Italy, although sometimes a passage is\r\n",
      "effected from one projecting portion of a house to another by means of\r\n",
      "an exterior gallery. These are very delightful objects; and when shaded\r\n",
      "by luxuriant vines, which is frequently the case, impart a gracefulness\r\n",
      "to the building otherwise unattainable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "30. The next striking point is the arcade at the base of the building.\r\n",
      "This is general in cities; and, although frequently wanting to the\r\n",
      "cottage, is present often enough to render it an important feature. In\r\n",
      "fact, the Italian cottage is usually found in groups. Isolated buildings\r\n",
      "are rare; and the arcade affords an agreeable, if not necessary, shade,\r\n",
      "in passing from one building to another. It is a still more unfailing\r\n",
      "feature of the Swiss city, where it is useful in deep snow. But the\r\n",
      "supports of the arches in Switzerland are generally square masses of\r\n",
      "wall, varying in size, separating the arches by irregular intervals, and\r\n",
      "sustained by broad and massy buttresses; while in Italy, the arches\r\n",
      "generally rest on legitimate columns, varying in height from one and a\r\n",
      "half to four diameters, with huge capitals, not unfrequently rich in\r\n",
      "detail. These give great gracefulness to the buildings in groups: they\r\n",
      "will be spoken of more at large when we are treating of arrangement and\r\n",
      "situation.\r\n",

      "truth of the scene might not be destroyed;[3] and, secondly, because it\r\n",
      "is impossible, or nearly so, to obtain a group of buildings of any sort,\r\n",

      "cottage is remarkable: the dark arcade, the sculptured capital, the\r\n",

      "brightness of effect, simplicity of form, and elevation of character.\r\n",
      "Let it not be supposed, however, that such a combination of attributes\r\n",
      "is rare; on the contrary, it is common to the greater part of the\r\n",
      "cottages of Italy. This building has not been selected as a rare\r\n",
      "example, but it is given as a good one. [These remarks refer to a cut in\r\n",
      "the magazine text, represented in the illustrated edition by a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "32. Having now reviewed the distinctive parts of the Italian cottage in\r\n",
      "detail, we shall proceed to direct our attention to points of general\r\n",
      "character. I. Simplicity of form. The roof, being flat, allows of no\r\n",
      "projecting garret windows, no fantastic gable ends: the walls themselves\r\n",
      "are equally flat; no bow-windows or sculptured oriels, such as we meet\r\n",
      "with perpetually in Germany, France, or the Netherlands, vary their\r\n",
      "white fronts. Now, this simplicity is, perhaps, the principal attribute\r\n",
      "by which the Italian cottage attains the elevation of character we\r\n",
      "desired and expected. All that is fantastic in form, or frivolous in\r\n",
      "detail, annihilates the aristocratic air of a building: it at once\r\n",
      "destroys its sublimity and size, besides awakening, as is almost always\r\n",
      "the case, associations of a mean and low character. The moment we see a\r\n",
      "gable roof, we think of cock-lofts; the instant we observe a projecting\r\n",
      "window, of attics and tent-bedsteads. Now, the Italian cottage assumes,\r\n",
      "with the simplicity, _l'air noble_ of buildings of a higher order; and,\r\n",
      "though it avoids all ridiculous miniature mimicry of the palace, it\r\n",
      "discards the humbler attributes of the cottage. The ornament it assumes\r\n",
      "is dignified; no grinning faces, or unmeaning notched planks, but\r\n",
      "well-proportioned arches, or tastefully sculptured columns. While there\r\n",
      "is nothing about it unsuited to the humility of its inhabitant, there is\r\n",
      "a general dignity in its air, which harmonizes beautifully with the\r\n",
      "nobility of the neighboring edifices, or the glory of the surrounding\r\n",
      "scenery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "33. II. Brightness of effect. There are no weather stains on the walls:\r\n",
      "there is no dampness in air or earth, by which they could be induced;\r\n",
      "the heat of the sun scorches away all lichens, and mosses and moldy\r\n",
      "vegetation. No thatch or stone crop on the roof unites the building with\r\n",
      "surrounding vegetation; all is clear, and warm, and sharp on the eye;\r\n",
      "the more distant the building, the more generally bright it becomes,\r\n",
      "till the distant village sparkles out of the orange copse, or the\r\n",
      "cypress grove, with so much distinctness as might be thought in some\r\n",
      "degree objectionable. But it must be remembered that the prevailing\r\n",
      "color of the Italian landscape is blue; sky, hills, water, are equally\r\n",
      "azure: the olive, which forms a great proportion of the vegetation, is\r\n",
      "not green, but gray; the cypress and its varieties, dark and neutral,\r\n",
      "and the laurel and myrtle far from bright. Now, white, which is\r\n",
      "intolerable with green, is agreeably contrasted with blue; and to this\r\n",
      "cause it must be ascribed that the white of the Italian building is not\r\n",
      "found startling and disagreeable in the landscape. That it is not, we\r\n",
      "believe, will be generally allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "34. III. Elegance of feeling. We never can prevent ourselves from\r\n",
      "imagining that we perceive in the graceful negligence of the Italian\r\n",
      "cottage, the evidence of a taste among the lower orders refined by the\r\n",
      "glory of their land, and the beauty of its remains. We have always had\r\n",
      "strong faith in the influence of climate on the mind, and feel strongly\r\n",
      "tempted to discuss the subject at length; but our paper has already\r\n",
      "exceeded its proposed limits, and we must content ourselves with\r\n",
      "remarking what will not, we think, be disputed, that the eye, by\r\n",
      "constantly resting either on natural scenery of noble tone and\r\n",
      "character, or on the architectural remains of classical beauty, must\r\n",
      "contract a habit of feeling correctly and tastefully; the influence of\r\n",
      "which, we think, is seen in the style of edifices the most modern and\r\n",
      "the most humble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "35. Lastly, Dilapidation. We have just used the term \"graceful\r\n",
      "negligence\": whether it be graceful, or not, is a matter of taste; but\r\n",
      "the uncomfortable and ruinous disorder and dilapidation of the Italian\r\n",
      "cottage is one of observation. The splendor of the climate requires\r\n",
      "nothing more than shade from the sun, and occasionally shelter from a\r\n",
      "violent storm: the outer arcade affords them both; it becomes the\r\n",
      "nightly lounge and daily dormitory of its inhabitant, and the interior\r\n",
      "is abandoned to filth and decay. Indolence watches the tooth of Time\r\n",
      "with careless eye and nerveless hand. Religion, or its abuse, reduces\r\n",
      "every individual of the population to utter inactivity three days out of\r\n",
      "the seven; and the habits formed in the three regulate the four. Abject\r\n",
      "poverty takes away the power, while brutish sloth weakens the will; and\r\n",
      "the filthy habits of the Italian prevent him from suffering from the\r\n",
      "state to which he is reduced. The shattered roofs, the dark, confused,\r\n",
      "ragged windows, the obscure chambers, the tattered and dirty draperies,\r\n",
      "altogether present a picture which, seen too near, is sometimes\r\n",
      "revolting to the eye, always melancholy to the mind. Yet even this many\r\n",
      "would not wish to be otherwise. The prosperity of nations, as of\r\n",
      "individuals, is cold and hard-hearted, and forgetful. The dead die,\r\n",
      "indeed, trampled down by the crowd of the living; the place thereof\r\n",
      "shall know them no more, for that place is not in the hearts of the\r\n",
      "survivors for whose interests they have made way. But adversity and ruin\r\n",
      "point to the sepulcher, and it is not trodden on; to the chronicle, and\r\n",
      "it doth not decay. Who would substitute the rush of a new nation, the\r\n",
      "struggle of an awakening power, for the dreamy sleep of Italy's\r\n",
      "desolation, for her sweet silence of melancholy thought, her twilight\r\n",
      "time of everlasting memories?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "36. Such, we think, are the principal distinctive attributes of the\r\n",

      "contemplation of its beauties; even though they are of a kind which the\r\n",

      "cricket is chirping on the lonely hearth, or the vulture soaring over\r\n",
      "the field of corpses, or the one mourner lamenting over the red ruins of\r\n",

      "this sense of solitude. Now, as it will only do so when it is seen at a\r\n",

      "another, which was not then noticed. Anything which, to the eye, is\r\n",

      "any part of its surface, will divide it into two portions, each of which\r\n",
      "will be individually measured by the eye, but which will never make the\r\n",
      "impression which they would have made, had their unity not been\r\n",
      "interrupted. A conspicuous cottage on a distant mountain side has this\r\n",

      "ascertain it to be a human habitation, it will answer the purpose of\r\n",
      "increasing the solitude quite as well as if it were evidently so;\r\n",
      "because this impression is produced by its appeal to the thoughts, not\r\n",
      "by its effect on the eye. Its color, therefore, should be as nearly as\r\n",

      "82. It now only remains for us to conclude the subject of the cottage,\r\n",
      "by a few general remarks on the just application of modern buildings to\r\n",
      "adorn or vivify natural scenery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are, we think, only three cases in which the cottage is considered\r\n",
      "as an element of architectural, or any other kind of beauty, since it is\r\n",
      "ordinarily raised by the peasant where he likes, and how he likes; and,\r\n",
      "therefore, as we have seen, frequently in good taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "83. I. When a nobleman, or man of fortune, amuses himself with\r\n",
      "superintending the erection of the domiciles of his domestics. II. When\r\n",
      "ornamental summer-houses, or mimicries of wigwams, are to be erected as\r\n",
      "ornamental adjuncts to a prospect which the owner has done all he can to\r\n",
      "spoil, that it may be worthy of the honor of having him to look at it.\r\n",
      "III. When the landlord exercises a certain degree of influence over the\r\n",
      "cottages of his tenants, or the improvements of the neighboring village,\r\n",
      "so as to induce such a tone of feeling in the new erections as he may\r\n",
      "think suitable to the situation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "84. In the first of these cases, there is little to be said; for the\r\n",
      "habitation of the domestic is generally a dependent feature of his\r\n",
      "master's, and, therefore, to be considered as a part of it. Porters'\r\n",
      "lodges are also dependent upon, and to be regulated by, the style of the\r\n",
      "architecture to which they are attached; and they are generally well\r\n",
      "managed in England, properly united with the gate, and adding to the\r\n",
      "effect of the entrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the second case, as the act is in itself a barbarism, it would be\r\n",
      "useless to consider what would be the best mode of perpetrating it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the third case, we think it will be useful to apply a few general\r\n",
      "principles, deduced from positions formerly advanced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "85. All buildings are, of course, to be considered in connection with\r\n",
      "the country in which they are to be raised. Now, all landscape must\r\n",
      "possess one out of four distinct characters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It must be either woody, the green country; cultivated, the blue\r\n",
      "country; wild, the gray country; or hilly, the brown country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I. The Woody, or green, Country. By this is to be understood the mixture\r\n",
      "of park, pasture, and variegated forest, which is only to be seen in\r\n",
      "temperate climates, and in those parts of a kingdom which have not often\r\n",
      "changed proprietors, but have remained in unproductive beauty (or at\r\n",
      "least, furnishing timber only), the garden of the wealthier population.\r\n",
      "It is to be seen in no other country, perhaps, so well as in England. In\r\n",
      "other districts, we find extensive masses of black forest, but not the\r\n",
      "mixture of sunny glade, and various foliage, and dewy sward, which we\r\n",
      "meet with in the richer park districts of England. This kind of country\r\n",
      "is always surgy, oceanic, and massy, in its outline: it never affords\r\n",
      "blue distances, unless seen from a height; and, even then, the nearer\r\n",
      "groups are large, and draw away the attention from the background. The\r\n",
      "under soil is kept cool by the shade, and its vegetation rich; so that\r\n",
      "the prevailing color, except for a few days at the fall of the leaf, is\r\n",
      "a fresh green. A good example of this kind of country is the view from\r\n",
      "Richmond Hill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "86. Now, first, let us consider what sort of feeling this green country\r\n",
      "excites; and, in order to do so, be it observed, that anything which is\r\n",
      "apparently enduring and unchangeable gives us an impression rather of\r\n",
      "future, than of past, duration of existence; but anything which being\r\n",
      "perishable, and from its nature subject to change, has yet existed to a\r\n",
      "great age, gives us an impression of antiquity, though, of course, none\r\n",
      "of stability. A mountain, for instance (not geologically speaking, for\r\n",
      "then the furrows on its brow give it age as visible as was ever wrinkled\r\n",
      "on human forehead, but considering it as it appears to ordinary eyes),\r\n",
      "appears to be beyond the influence of change: it does not put us in mind\r\n",
      "of its past existence, by showing us any of the effect of time upon\r\n",
      "itself; we do not feel that it is old, because it is not approaching any\r\n",
      "kind of death; it is a mass of unsentient undecaying matter, which, if\r\n",
      "we think about it, we discover must have existed for some time, but\r\n",
      "which does not tell this fact to our feelings, or, rather, which tells\r\n",
      "us of no time at which it came into existence; and therefore, gives us\r\n",
      "no standard by which to measure its age, which, unless measured, cannot\r\n",
      "be distinctly felt. But a very old forest tree is a thing subject to the\r\n",
      "same laws of nature as ourselves: it is an energetic being, liable to an\r\n",
      "approaching death; its age is written on every spray; and, because we\r\n",
      "see it is susceptible of life and annihilation, like our own, we imagine\r\n",
      "it must be capable of the same feelings, and possess the same faculties,\r\n",
      "and, above all others, memory: it is always telling us about the past,\r\n",
      "never pointing to the future; we appeal to it, as to a thing which has\r\n",
      "seen and felt during a life similar to our own, though of ten times its\r\n",
      "duration, and therefore receive from it a perpetual impression of\r\n",
      "antiquity. So again a ruined town gives us an impression of antiquity;\r\n",
      "the stones of which it is built, none; for their age is not written upon\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "87. This being the case, it is evident that the chief feeling induced by\r\n",
      "woody country is one of reverence for its antiquity. There is a quiet\r\n",
      "melancholy about the decay of the patriarchal trunks, which is enhanced\r\n",
      "by the green and elastic vigor of the young saplings; the noble form of\r\n",
      "the forest aisles, and the subdued light which penetrates their\r\n",
      "entangled boughs, combine to add to the impression; and the whole\r\n",
      "character of the scene is calculated to excite conservative feeling.\r\n",
      "The man who could remain a radical in a wood country is a disgrace to\r\n",
      "his species.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "88. Now, this feeling of mixed melancholy and veneration is the one of\r\n",
      "all others which the modern cottage must not be allowed to violate. It\r\n",
      "may be fantastic or rich in detail; for the one character will make it\r\n",
      "look old-fashioned, and the other will assimilate with the intertwining\r\n",
      "of leaf and bough around it: but it must not be spruce, or natty, or\r\n",
      "very bright in color; and the older it looks the better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little grotesqueness in form is the more allowable, because the\r\n",
      "imagination is naturally active in the obscure and indefinite daylight\r\n",
      "of wood scenery; conjures up innumerable beings, of every size and\r\n",
      "shape, to people its alleys and smile through its thickets; and is by no\r\n",
      "means displeased to find some of its inventions half-realized in a\r\n",
      "decorated panel or grinning extremity of a rafter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "89. These characters being kept in view, as objects to be attained, the\r\n",
      "remaining considerations are technical.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the form. Select any well-grown group of the tree which prevails\r\n",
      "most near the proposed site of the cottage. Its summit will be a rounded\r\n",
      "mass. Take the three principal points of its curve: namely, its apex and\r\n",
      "the two points where it unites itself with neighboring masses. Strike a\r\n",
      "circle through these three points; and the angle contained in the\r\n",
      "segment cut off by a line joining the two lower points is to be the\r\n",
      "angle of the cottage roof. (Of course we are not thinking of interior\r\n",
      "convenience: the architect must establish his mode of beauty first, and\r\n",
      "then approach it as nearly as he can.) This angle will generally be very\r\n",
      "obtuse; and this is one reason why the Swiss cottage is always beautiful\r\n",
      "when it is set among walnut or chestnut trees. Its obtuse roof is just\r\n",
      "about the true angle. With pines or larches, the angle should not be\r\n",
      "regulated by the form of the tree, but by the slope of the branches. The\r\n",
      "building itself should be low and long, so that, if possible, it may not\r\n",
      "be seen all at once, but may be partially concealed by trunks or leafage\r\n",
      "at various distances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "90. For the color, that of wood is always beautiful. If the wood of the\r\n",
      "near trees be used, so much the better; but the timbers should be\r\n",
      "rough-hewn, and allowed to get weather-stained. Cold colors will not\r\n",
      "suit with green; and, therefore, slated roofs are disagreeable, unless,\r\n",
      "as in the Westmoreland cottage, the gray roof is warmed with lichenous\r\n",
      "vegetation, when it will do well with anything; but thatch is better. If\r\n",
      "the building be not of wood, the walls may be built of anything which\r\n",
      "will give them a quiet and unobtruding warmth of tone. White, if in\r\n",
      "shade, is sometimes allowable; but, if visible at any point more than\r\n",
      "200 yards off, it will spoil the whole landscape. In general, as we saw\r\n",
      "before, the building will bear some fantastic finishing, that is, if it\r\n",
      "be entangled in forest; but, if among massive groups of trees, separated\r\n",
      "by smooth sward, it must be kept simple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "91. II. The Cultivated, or blue, Country. This is the rich champaign\r\n",
      "land, in which large trees are more sparingly scattered, and which is\r\n",
      "chiefly devoted to the purposes of agriculture. In this we are\r\n",
      "perpetually getting blue distances from the slightest elevation, which\r\n",
      "are rendered more decidedly so by their contrast with warm corn or\r\n",
      "plowed fields in the foreground. Such is the greater part of England.\r\n",
      "The view from the hills of Malvern is a good example. In districts of\r\n",
      "this kind, all is change; one year's crop has no memory of its\r\n",
      "predecessor; all is activity, prosperity, and usefulness: nothing is\r\n",
      "left to the imagination; there is no obscurity, no poetry, no nonsense:\r\n",
      "the colors of the landscape are bright and varied; it is thickly\r\n",
      "populated, and glowing with animal life. Here, then, the character of\r\n",
      "the cottage must be cheerfulness; its colors may be vivid: white is\r\n",
      "always beautiful; even red tiles are allowable, and red bricks\r\n",
      "endurable. Neatness will not spoil it: the angle of its roof may be\r\n",
      "acute, its windows sparkling, and its roses red and abundant; but it\r\n",
      "must not be ornamented nor fantastic, it must be evidently built for the\r\n",
      "uses of common life, and have a matter-of-fact business-like air about\r\n",
      "it. Its outhouses and pigsties, and dunghills should therefore, be kept\r\n",
      "in sight: the latter may be made very pretty objects, by twisting them\r\n",
      "with the pitchfork, and plaiting them into braids, as the Swiss do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "92. III. The Wild, or gray, Country. \"Wild\" is not exactly a correct\r\n",
      "epithet; we mean wide, uninclosed, treeless undulations of land, whether\r\n",
      "cultivated or not. The greater part of northern France, though well\r\n",
      "brought under the plow, would come under the denomination of gray\r\n",
      "country. Occasional masses of monotonous forest do not destroy this\r\n",
      "character. Here, size is desirable, and massiness of form; but we must\r\n",
      "have no brightness of color in the cottage, otherwise it would draw the\r\n",
      "eye to it at three miles off, and the whole landscape would be covered\r\n",
      "with conspicuous dots. White is agreeable, if sobered down; slate\r\n",
      "allowable on the roof as well as thatch. For the rest, we need only\r\n",
      "refer to the remarks made on the propriety of the French cottage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "93. Lastly, Hill, or brown, Country. And here if we look to England\r\n",
      "alone, as peculiarly a cottage country, the remarks formerly advanced,\r\n",
      "in the consideration of the Westmoreland cottage, are sufficient; but if\r\n",
      "we go into mountain districts of more varied character, we shall find a\r\n",
      "difference existing between every range of hills, which will demand a\r\n",
      "corresponding difference in the style of their cottages. The principles,\r\n",
      "however, are the same in all situations, and it would be a hopeless task\r\n",
      "to endeavor to give more than general principles. In hill country,\r\n",
      "however, another question is introduced, whose investigation is\r\n",
      "peculiarly necessary in cases in which the ground has inequality of\r\n",
      "surface, that of position. And the difficulty here is, not so much to\r\n",
      "ascertain where the building ought to be, as to put it there, without\r\n",
      "suggesting any inquiry as to the mode in which it got there; to prevent\r\n",
      "its just application from appearing artificial. But we cannot enter into\r\n",
      "this inquiry, before laying down a number of principles of composition,\r\n",
      "which are applicable, not only to cottages, but generally; and which we\r\n",
      "cannot deduce until we come to the consideration of buildings in\r\n",
      "groups.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "94. Such are the great divisions under which country and rural buildings\r\n",
      "may be comprehended; but there are intermediate conditions, in which\r\n",
      "modified forms of the cottage are applicable; and it frequently happens\r\n",
      "that country which, considered in the abstract, would fall under one of\r\n",
      "these classes, possesses, owing to its peculiar climate or associations,\r\n",
      "a very different character. Italy, for instance, is blue country; yet it\r\n",
      "has not the least resemblance to English blue country. We have paid\r\n",
      "particular attention to wood; first, because we had not, in any previous\r\n",
      "paper, considered what was beautiful in a forest cottage; and secondly,\r\n",
      "because in such districts there is generally much more influence\r\n",
      "exercised by proprietors over their tenantry, than in populous and\r\n",
      "cultivated districts; and our English park scenery, though exquisitely\r\n",
      "beautiful, is sometimes, we think, a little monotonous, from the want of\r\n",
      "this very feature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "95. And now, farewell to the cottage, and, with it, to the humility of\r\n",
      "natural scenery. We are sorry to leave it; not that we have any idea of\r\n",
      "living in a cottage, as a comfortable thing; not that we prefer mud to\r\n",
      "marble, or deal to mahogany; but that, with it, we leave much of what is\r\n",
      "most beautiful of earth, the low and bee-inhabited scenery, which is\r\n",
      "full of quiet and prideless emotion, of such calmness as we can imagine\r\n",
      "prevailing over our earth when it was new in heaven. We are going into\r\n",
      "higher walks of architecture, where we shall find a less close\r\n",
      "connection established between the building and the soil on which it\r\n",
      "stands, or the air with which it is surrounded, but a closer connection\r\n",
      "with the character of its inhabitant. We shall have less to do with\r\n",
      "natural feeling, and more with human passion; we are coming out of\r\n",
      "stillness into turbulence, out of seclusion into the multitude, out of\r\n",

      "beautiful in a group, we must ascertain what is desirable in the parts\r\n",
      "which compose it, separately considered; and therefore it will be most\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "97. Man, the peasant, is a being of more marked national character, than\r\n",
      "man, the educated and refined. For nationality is founded, in a great\r\n",
      "degree, on prejudices and feelings inculcated and aroused in youth,\r\n",
      "which grow inveterate in the mind as long as its views are confined to\r\n",
      "the place of its birth; its ideas molded by the customs of its country,\r\n",
      "and its conversation limited to a circle composed of individuals of\r\n",
      "habits and feelings like its own; but which are gradually softened down,\r\n",
      "and eradicated, when the mind is led into general views of things, when\r\n",
      "it is guided by reflection instead of habit, and has begun to lay aside\r\n",
      "opinions contracted under the influence of association and\r\n",
      "prepossession, substituting in their room philosophical deductions from\r\n",
      "the calm contemplation of the various tempers, and thoughts, and\r\n",
      "customs, of mankind. The love of its country will remain with\r\n",
      "undiminished strength in the cultivated mind, but the national modes of\r\n",
      "thinking will vanish from the disciplined intellect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "98. Now as it is only by these mannerisms of thought that architecture\r\n",
      "is affected, we shall find that, the more polished the mind of its\r\n",
      "designer, the less national will be the building; for its architect will\r\n",
      "be led away by a search after a model of ideal beauty, and will not be\r\n",
      "involuntarily guided by deep-rooted feelings, governing irresistibly his\r\n",
      "heart and hand. He will therefore be in perpetual danger of forgetting\r\n",
      "the necessary unison of scene and climate, and, following up the chase\r\n",
      "of the ideal, will neglect the beauty of the natural; an error which he\r\n",
      "could not commit, were he less general in his views, for then the\r\n",
      "prejudices to which he would be subject, would be as truly in unison\r\n",
      "with the objects which created them, as answering notes with the chords\r\n",
      "which awaken them. We must not, therefore, be surprised, if buildings\r\n",
      "bearing impress of the exercise of fine thought and high talent in their\r\n",
      "design, should yet offend us by perpetual discords with scene and\r\n",
      "climate; and if, therefore, we sometimes derive less instruction, and\r\n",
      "less pleasure from the columnar portico of the Palace, than from the\r\n",
      "latched door of the Cottage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "99. Again: man, in his hours of relaxation, when he is engaged in the\r\n",
      "pursuit of mere pleasure, is less national than when he is under the\r\n",
      "influence of any of the more violent feelings which agitate everyday\r\n",
      "life. The reason of this may at first appear somewhat obscure, but it\r\n",
      "will become evident, on a little reflection. Aristotle's definition of\r\n",
      "pleasure, perhaps the best ever given, is \"an agitation, and settling of\r\n",
      "the spirit into its own proper nature;\" similar, by the by, to the\r\n",
      "giving of liberty of motion to the molecules of a mineral, followed by\r\n",
      "their crystallization, into their own proper form. Now this \"proper\r\n",
      "nature,\" [Greek: hyparchousan physin], is not the acquired national\r\n",
      "habit, but the common and universal constitution of the human soul. This\r\n",
      "constitution is kept under by the feelings which prompt to action, for\r\n",
      "those feelings depend upon parts of character, or of prejudice, which\r\n",
      "are peculiar to individuals or to nations; and the pleasure which all\r\n",
      "men seek is a kind of partial casting away of these more active\r\n",
      "feelings, to return to the calm and unchanging constitution of mind\r\n",
      "which is the same in all.\r\n",

      "religion, war, or ambition, is national, but in relaxation he manifests\r\n",
      "a nature common to every individual of his race. A Turk, for instance,\r\n",

      "much as the one has a mouthpiece of amber, and the other one of sealing\r\n",

      "shall find much nationality in the Church or the Fortress, or in any\r\n",
      "building devoted to the purposes of active life, but very little in that\r\n",
      "which is dedicated exclusively to relaxation, the Villa. We shall be\r\n",

      "may be called; the first of which is a square white mass, decorated with\r\n",
      "pilasters of no order, set in a green avenue, sloping down to the water;\r\n",
      "the second is an imitation, we suppose, of something possessing\r\n",
      "theoretical existence in Switzerland, with sharp gable ends, and wooden\r\n",
      "flourishes turning the corners, set on a little dumpy mound with a slate\r\n",

      "blue dark-looking box, squeezed up into a group of straggly larches,\r\n",

      "have obtained some data by which to judge of her more fortunate\r\n",
      "edifices. We notice the mountain villa first, for two reasons; because\r\n",
      "effect is always more considered in its erection, than when it is to be\r\n",
      "situated in a less interesting country, and because the effect desired\r\n",
      "is very rarely given, there being far greater difficulties to contend\r\n",
      "with. But one word more, before setting off for the south. Though, as we\r\n",
      "saw before, the gentleman has less _national_ character than the boor,\r\n",
      "his _individual_ character is more marked, especially in its finer\r\n",
      "features, which are clearly and perfectly developed by education;\r\n",
      "consequently, when the inhabitant of the villa has had anything to do\r\n",

      "this is no part of our present task; at some future period we hope to\r\n",
      "give a series of essays on the habitations of the most distinguished men\r\n",
      "of Europe, showing how the alterations which they directed, and the\r\n",
      "expression which they bestowed, corresponded with the turn of their\r\n",
      "emotions, and leading intellectual faculties: but at present we have to\r\n",
      "deal only with generalities; we have to ascertain not what will be\r\n",
      "pleasing to a single mind, but what will afford gratification to every\r\n",
      "eye possessing a certain degree of experience, and every mind endowed\r\n",
      "with a certain degree of taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "103. Without further preface, therefore, let us endeavor to ascertain\r\n",
      "what would be theoretically beautiful, on the shore, or among the\r\n",
      "scenery of the Larian Lake, preparatory to a sketch of the general\r\n",
      "features of those villas which exist there, in too great a multitude to\r\n",
      "admit, on our part, of much individual detail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the general tone of the scenery, we may refer to the paper on the\r\n",
      "Italian cottage; for the shores of the Lake of Como have generally the\r\n",
      "character there described, with a little more cheerfulness, and a little\r\n",
      "less elevation,[14] but aided by great variety of form. They are not\r\n",
      "quite so rich in vegetation as the plains: both because the soil is\r\n",
      "scanty, there being, of course, no decomposition going on among the\r\n",
      "rocks of black marble which form the greater part of the shore; and\r\n",
      "because the mountains rise steeply from the water, leaving only a narrow\r\n",
      "zone at their bases in the climate of Italy. In that zone, however, the\r\n",
      "olive grows in great luxuriance, with the cypress, orange, aloe, myrtle,\r\n",
      "and vine, the latter always trellised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Footnote 14: That Italian mountain scenery has less elevation of\r\n",
      "character than the plains may appear singular; but there are many simple\r\n",
      "reasons for a fact which, we doubt not, has been felt by every one\r\n",
      "(capable of feeling anything), who ever left the Alps to pass into\r\n",
      "Lombardy. The first is, that a mountain scene, as we saw in the last\r\n",
      "paper, bears no traces of decay, since it never possessed any of life.\r\n",
      "The desolation of the sterile peaks, never having been interrupted, is\r\n",
      "altogether free from the melancholy which is consequent on the passing\r\n",
      "away of interruption. They stood up in the time of Italy's glory, into\r\n",
      "the voiceless air, while all the life and light which she remembers now\r\n",
      "was working and moving at their feet, an animated cloud, which they did\r\n",
      "not feel, and do not miss. That region of life never reached up their\r\n",
      "flanks, and has left them no memorials of its being; they have no\r\n",
      "associations, no monuments, no memories; we look on them as we would on\r\n",
      "other hills; things of abstract and natural magnificence, which the\r\n",
      "presence of man could not increase, nor his departure sadden. They are,\r\n",
      "in consequence, destitute of all that renders the name of Ausonia\r\n",
      "thrilling, or her champaigns beautiful, beyond the mere splendor of\r\n",
      "climate; and even that splendor is unshared by the mountain; its cold\r\n",
      "atmosphere being undistinguished by any of that rich, purple, ethereal\r\n",
      "transparency which gives the air of the plains its _depth of\r\n",
      "feeling_,--we can find no better expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly. In all hill scenery, though there is increase of size, there\r\n",
      "is want of distance. We are not speaking of views from summits, but of\r\n",
      "the average aspect of valleys. Suppose the mountains be 10,000 feet\r\n",
      "high, their summit will not be more than six miles distant in a direct\r\n",
      "line: and there is a general sense of confinement, induced by their\r\n",
      "wall-like boundaries, which is painful, contrasted with the wide\r\n",
      "expatiation of spirit induced by a distant view over plains. In ordinary\r\n",
      "countries, however, where the plain is an uninteresting mass of\r\n",
      "cultivation, the sublimity of distance is not to be compared to that of\r\n",
      "size: but, where every yard of the cultivated country has its tale to\r\n",
      "tell; where it is perpetually intersected by rivers whose names are\r\n",
      "meaning music, and glancing with cities and villages every one of which\r\n",
      "has its own halo round its head; and where the eye is carried by the\r\n",
      "clearness of the air over the blue of the farthest horizon, without\r\n",
      "finding one wreath of mist, or one shadowy cloud, to check the\r\n",
      "distinctness of the impression; the mental emotions excited are richer,\r\n",
      "and deeper, and swifter than could be awakened by the noblest hills of\r\n",
      "the earth, unconnected with the deeds of men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly. The plain country of Italy has not even to choose between the\r\n",
      "glory of distance and of size, for it has both. I do not think there is\r\n",
      "a spot, from Venice to Messina, where two ranges of mountain, at the\r\n",
      "least, are not in sight at the same time. In Lombardy, the Alps are on\r\n",
      "one side, the Apennines on the other; in the Venetian territory, the\r\n",
      "Alps, Apennines and Euganean hills; going southward, the Apennines\r\n",
      "always, their outworks running far towards the sea, and the coast itself\r\n",
      "frequently mountainous. Now, the aspect of a noble range of hills, at a\r\n",
      "considerable distance, is, in our opinion, far more imposing (considered\r\n",
      "in the abstract) than they are, seen near: their height is better told,\r\n",
      "their outlines softer and more melodious, their majesty more mysterious.\r\n",
      "But, in Italy, they gain more by distance than majesty: they gain life.\r\n",
      "They cease to be the cold forgetful things they were; they hold the\r\n",
      "noble plains in their lap, and become venerable, as having looked down\r\n",
      "upon them, and watched over them forever, unchanging; they become part\r\n",
      "of the picture of associations: we endow them with memory, and then feel\r\n",
      "them to be possessed of all that is glorious on earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For these three reasons, then, the plains of Italy possess far more\r\n",
      "elevation of character than her hill scenery. To the northward, this\r\n",
      "contrast is felt very strikingly, as the distinction is well marked, the\r\n",
      "Alps rising sharply and suddenly. To the southward, the plain is more\r\n",
      "mingled with low projecting promontories, and unites almost every kind\r\n",
      "of beauty. However, even among her northern lakes, the richness of the\r\n",
      "low climate, and the magnificence of form and color presented by the\r\n",
      "distant Alps, raise the character of the scene immeasurably above that\r\n",
      "of most hill landscapes, even were those natural features entirely\r\n",
      "unassisted by associations which, though more sparingly scattered than\r\n",
      "in the south, are sufficient to give light to every leaf, and voice to\r\n",
      "every wave.]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "104. Now, as to the situation of the cottage, we have already seen that\r\n",
      "great humility was necessary, both in the building and its site, to\r\n",
      "prevent it from offending us by an apparent struggle with forces,\r\n",
      "compared with which its strength was dust: but we cannot have this\r\n",
      "extreme humility in the villa, the dwelling of wealth and power, and yet\r\n",
      "we must not, any more, suggest the idea of its resisting natural\r\n",
      "influences under which the Pyramids could not abide. The only way of\r\n",
      "solving the difficulty is, to select such sites as shall seem to have\r\n",
      "been set aside by nature as places of rest, as points of calm and\r\n",
      "enduring beauty, ordained to sit and smile in their glory of quietness,\r\n",
      "while the avalanche brands the mountain top,[15] and the torrent\r\n",
      "desolates the valley; yet so preserved, not by shelter amidst violence,\r\n",
      "but by being placed wholly out of the influence of violence. For in this\r\n",
      "they must differ from the site of the cottage, that the peasant may seek\r\n",
      "for protection under some low rock or in some narrow dell, but the villa\r\n",
      "must have a domain to itself, at once conspicuous, beautiful, and calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Footnote 15: There are two kinds of winter avalanches; the one, sheets\r\n",
      "of frozen snow sliding on the surface of others. The swiftness of these,\r\n",
      "as the clavendier of the Convent of St. Bernard told me, he could\r\n",
      "compare to nothing but that of a cannon ball of equal size. The other is\r\n",
      "a rolling mass of snow, accumulating in its descent. This, grazing the\r\n",
      "bare hill-side, tears up its surface like dust, bringing away soil,\r\n",
      "rock, and vegetation, as a grazing ball tears flesh; and leaving its\r\n",
      "withered path distinct on the green hill-side, as if the mountain had\r\n",
      "been branded with red-hot iron. They generally keep to the same paths;\r\n",
      "but when the snow accumulates, and sends one down the wrong way, it has\r\n",
      "been known to cut down a pine forest, as a scythe mows grass. The tale\r\n",
      "of its work is well told by the seared and branded marks on the hill\r\n",
      "summits and sides.]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "105. As regards the form of the cottage, we have seen how the\r\n",
      "Westmoreland cottage harmonized with the ease of outline so conspicuous\r\n",
      "in hill scenery, by the irregularity of its details; but, here, no such\r\n",
      "irregularity is allowable or consistent, and is not even desirable. For\r\n",
      "the cottage enhances the wildness of the surrounding scene, by\r\n",
      "sympathizing with it; the villa must do the same thing, by contrasting\r\n",
      "with it. The eye feels, in a far greater degree, the terror of the\r\n",
      "distant and desolate peaks, when it passes down their ravined sides to\r\n",
      "sloping and verdant hills, and is guided from these to the rich glow of\r\n",
      "vegetable life in the low zones, and through this glow to the tall front\r\n",
      "of some noble edifice, peaceful even in its pride. But this contrast\r\n",
      "must not be sudden, or it will be startling and harsh; and therefore, as\r\n",
      "we saw above, the villa must be placed where all the severe features of\r\n",
      "the scene, though not concealed, are distant, and where there is a\r\n",
      "graduation, so to speak, of impressions, from terror to loveliness, the\r\n",
      "one softened by distance, the other elevated in its style: and the form\r\n",
      "of the villa must not be fantastic or angular, but must be full of\r\n",
      "variety, so tempered by simplicity as to obtain ease of outline united\r\n",
      "with elevation of character; the first being necessary for reasons\r\n",
      "before advanced, and the second, that the whole may harmonize with the\r\n",
      "feelings induced by the lofty features of the accompanying scenery in\r\n",
      "any hill country, and yet more, on the Larian Lake, by the deep memories\r\n",
      "and everlasting associations which haunt the stillness of its shore. Of\r\n",
      "the color required by Italian landscape we have spoken before, and we\r\n",
      "shall see that, particularly in this case, white or pale tones are\r\n",
      "agreeable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "106. We shall now proceed to the situation and form of the villa. As\r\n",
      "regards situation; the villas of the Lago di Como are built, _par\r\n",
      "préférence_, either on jutting promontories of low crag covered with\r\n",
      "olives, or on those parts of the shore where some mountain stream has\r\n",
      "carried out a bank of alluvium into the lake. One object proposed in\r\n",
      "this choice of situation is, to catch the breeze as it comes up the main\r\n",
      "opening of the hills, and to avoid the reflection of the sun's rays from\r\n",
      "the rocks of the actual shore; and another is, to obtain a prospect up\r\n",
      "or down the lake, and of the hills on whose projection the villa is\r\n",
      "built: but the effect of this choice when the building is considered the\r\n",
      "object, is to carry it exactly into the place where it ought to be, far\r\n",
      "from the steep precipice and dark mountain, to the border of the winding\r\n",
      "bay and citron-scented cape, where it stands at once conspicuous and in\r\n",
      "peace. For instance, in the view of Villa Serbelloni[16] from across the\r\n",
      "lake, although the eye falls suddenly from the crags above to the\r\n",
      "promontory below, yet all the sublime and severe features of the scene\r\n",
      "are kept in the distance, and the villa itself is mingled with graceful\r\n",
      "lines, and embosomed in rich vegetation. The promontory separates the\r\n",
      "Lake of Lecco from that of Como, properly so-called, and is three miles\r\n",
      "from the opposite shore, which gives room enough for aërial perspective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Footnote 16: [Villa Serbelloni, now the dépendence of the Hôtel Grande\r\n",
      "Bretagne at Bellaggio, and Villa Somma-Riva, now called Villa Carlotta,\r\n",
      "at Cadenabbia, and visited by every tourist for its collection of modern\r\n",
      "statuary, are both too well known to need illustration by the very poor\r\n",
      "wood-cuts which accompanied this chapter in the \"Architectural\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "107. We shall now consider the form of the villa. It is generally the\r\n",
      "apex of a series of artificial terraces, which conduct through its\r\n",
      "gardens to the water. These are formal in their design, but extensive,\r\n",
      "wide, and majestic in their slope, the steps being generally about 1/2\r\n",
      "ft. high and 4-1/2 ft. wide (sometimes however much deeper). They are\r\n",
      "generally supported by white wall, strengthened by unfilled arches, the\r\n",
      "angles being turned by sculptured pedestals, surmounted by statues, or\r\n",
      "urns. Along the terraces are carried rows, sometimes of cypress, more\r\n",
      "frequently of orange or lemon trees, with myrtles, sweet bay, and aloes,\r\n",
      "intermingled, but always with dark and spiry cypresses occurring in\r\n",
      "groups; and attached to these terraces, or to the villa itself, are\r\n",
      "series of arched grottoes built (or sometimes cut in the rock) for\r\n",
      "coolness, frequently overhanging the water, kept dark and fresh, and\r\n",
      "altogether delicious to the feelings. A good instance of these united\r\n",
      "peculiarities is seen in Villa Somma-Riva, Lago di Como.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of these approaches is disputable. It is displeasing to many,\r\n",
      "from its formality; but we are persuaded that it is right, because it is\r\n",
      "a national style, and therefore has in all probability due connection\r\n",
      "with scene and character: and this connection we shall endeavor to\r\n",
      "prove.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "108. The frequent occurrence of the arch is always delightful in distant\r\n",
      "effect, partly on account of its graceful line, partly because the shade\r\n",
      "it casts is varied in depth, becoming deeper and deeper as the grotto\r\n",
      "retires, and partly because it gives great apparent elevation to the\r\n",
      "walls which it supports. The grottoes themselves are agreeable objects\r\n",
      "seen near, because they give an impression of coolness to the eye; and\r\n",
      "they echo all sounds with great melody; small streams are often\r\n",
      "conducted through them, occasioning slight breezes by their motion. Then\r\n",
      "the statue and the urn are graceful in their outline, classical in their\r\n",
      "meaning, and correct in their position, for where could they be more\r\n",
      "appropriate than here; the one ministering to memory, and the other to\r\n",
      "mourning. The terraces themselves are dignified in their character (a\r\n",
      "necessary effect, as we saw above), and even the formal rows of trees\r\n",
      "are right in this climate, for a peculiar reason. Effect is always to be\r\n",
      "considered, in Italy, as if the sun were always to shine, for it does\r\n",
      "nine days out of ten. Now the shadows of foliage regularly disposed,\r\n",
      "fall with a grace which it is impossible to describe, running up and\r\n",
      "down across the marble steps, and casting alternate statues into\r\n",
      "darkness; and checkering the white walls with a \"method in their\r\n",
      "madness,\" altogether unattainable by loose grouping of trees; and\r\n",
      "therefore, for the sake of this kind of shade, to which the eye, as well\r\n",
      "as the feeling, is attracted, the long row of cypresses or orange trees\r\n",
      "is allowable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "109. But there is a still more important reason for it, of a directly\r\n",
      "contrary nature to that which its formality would seem to require. In\r\n",
      "all beautiful designs of exterior descent, a certain regularity is\r\n",
      "necessary; the lines should be graceful, but they must balance each\r\n",
      "other, slope answering to slope, statue to statue. Now this mathematical\r\n",
      "regularity would hurt the eye excessively in the midst of scenes of\r\n",
      "natural grace, were it executed in bare stone; but, if we make part of\r\n",
      "the design itself foliage, and put in touches of regular shade,\r\n",
      "alternating with the stone, whose distances and darkness are as\r\n",
      "mathematically limited as the rest of the grouping, but whose nature is\r\n",
      "changeful and varied in individual forms, we have obtained a link\r\n",
      "between nature and art, a step of transition, leading the feelings\r\n",
      "gradually from the beauty of regularity to that of freedom. And this\r\n",
      "effect would not be obtained, as might at first appear, by intermingling\r\n",
      "trees of different kinds, at irregular distances, or wherever they chose\r\n",
      "to grow; for then the design and the foliage would be instantly\r\n",
      "separated by the eye, the symmetry of the one would be interrupted, the\r\n",

      "pure moonlight. The whole glory of the design consists in its unison\r\n",
      "with the dignity of the landscape, and with the classical tone of the\r\n",
      "country. Take it away from its concomitant circumstances, and, instead\r\n",
      "of conducting the eye to it by a series of lofty and dreamy impressions,\r\n",

      "pale limestone[17] among the hills to the south; but this marble, or\r\n",
      "primitive limestone (for it is not highly crystalline), is not only more\r\n",
      "easy of access, but a more durable stone. Of this, consequently, almost\r\n",
      "all the buildings on the lake shore are built; and, therefore, were\r\n",
      "their material unconcealed, would be of a dark monotonous and melancholy\r\n",
      "gray tint, equally uninteresting to the eye, and depressing to the mind.\r\n",
      "To prevent this result, they are covered with different compositions,\r\n",
      "sometimes white, more frequently cream-colored, and of varying depth;\r\n",
      "the moldings and pilasters being frequently of deeper tones than the\r\n",

      "impropriety. The first circumstance in its favor is one which, though\r\n",
      "connected only with lake scenery, we shall notice at length, as it is a\r\n",
      "point of high importance in our own country. When a small piece of quiet\r\n",
      "water reposes in a valley, or lies embosomed among crags, its chief\r\n",
      "beauty is derived from our perception of crystalline depth, united with\r\n",
      "excessive slumber. In its limited surface we cannot get the sublimity of\r\n",
      "extent, but we may have the beauty of peace, and the majesty of depth.\r\n",
      "The object must therefore be, to get the eye off its surface, and to\r\n",
      "draw it down, to beguile it into that fairy land underneath, which is\r\n",
      "more beautiful than what it repeats, because it is all full of dreams\r\n",
      "unattainable, and illimitable. This can only be done by keeping its edge\r\n",
      "out of sight, and guiding the eye off the land into the reflection, as\r\n",
      "if it were passing into a mist, until it finds itself swimming into the\r\n",
      "blue sky, with a thrill of unfathomable falling. (If there be not a\r\n",
      "touch of sky at the bottom, the water will be disagreeably black, and\r\n",
      "the clearer the more fearful.) Now, one touch of _white_ reflection of\r\n",
      "an object at the edge will destroy the whole illusion, for it will come\r\n",
      "like the flash of light on armor, and will show the surface, not the\r\n",
      "depth: it will tell the eye whereabouts it is; will define the limit of\r\n",
      "the edge; and will turn the dream of limitless depth into a small,\r\n",
      "uninteresting, reposeless piece of water. In all small lakes or pools,\r\n",
      "therefore, steep borders of dark crag, or of thick foliage, are to be\r\n",
      "obtained, if possible; even a shingly shore will spoil them: and this\r\n",
      "was one reason, it will be remembered for our admiration of the color of\r\n",
      "the Westmoreland cottage, because it never broke the repose of water by\r\n",
      "its reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "115. But this principle applies only to small pieces of water, on which\r\n",
      "we look down, as much as along the surface. As soon as we get a sheet,\r\n",
      "even if only a mile across, we lose depth; first, because it is almost\r\n",
      "impossible to get the surface without a breeze on some part of it; and,\r\n",
      "again, because we look along it, and get a great deal of sky in the\r\n",
      "reflection, which, when occupying too much space, tells as mere flat\r\n",
      "light. But we may have the beauty of extent in a very high degree; and\r\n",
      "it is therefore desirable to know how far the water goes, that we may\r\n",
      "have a clear conception of its space. Now, its border, at a great\r\n",
      "distance, is always lost, unless it be defined by a very distinct line;\r\n",
      "and such a line is harsh, flat, and cutting on the eye. To avoid this,\r\n",
      "the border itself should be dark, as in the other case, so that there\r\n",
      "may be no continuous horizontal line of demarcation; but one or two\r\n",
      "bright white objects should be set here and there along or near the\r\n",
      "edge: their reflections will flash on the dark water, and will inform\r\n",
      "the eye in a moment of the whole distance and transparency of the\r\n",
      "surface it is traversing. When there is a slight swell on the water,\r\n",
      "they will come down in long, beautiful, perpendicular lines, mingling\r\n",
      "exquisitely with the streaky green of reflected foliage; when there is\r\n",

      "either by loveliness in the object exciting it, or by a feeling of pride\r\n",

      "always forces upon the attention, the rectangular lines of the blocks,\r\n",
      "which, however nicely fitted they may be, are \"horrible! most horrible!\"\r\n",
      "There is also a great deal of ease and softness in the angular lines of\r\n",
      "the stucco, which are never sharp or harsh, like those of stone; and it\r\n",
      "receives shadows with great beauty, a point of infinite importance in\r\n",
      "this climate; giving them lightness and transparency, without any\r\n",
      "diminution of depth. It is also agreeable to the eye, to pass from the\r\n",
      "sharp carving of the marble decorations to the ease and smoothness of\r\n",
      "the stucco; while the utter want of interest in those parts which are\r\n",
      "executed in it prevents the humility of the material from being\r\n",
      "offensive: for this passage of the eye from the marble to the\r\n",
      "composition is managed with the dexterity of the artist, who, that the\r\n",
      "attention may be drawn to the single point of the picture which is his\r\n",
      "subject, leaves the rest so obscured and slightly painted, that the mind\r\n",
      "loses it altogether in its attention to the principal feature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "122. With all, however, that can be alleged in extenuation of its\r\n",
      "faults, it cannot be denied that the stucco _does_ take away so much of\r\n",
      "the dignity of the building, that, unless we find enough bestowed by its\r\n",
      "form and details to counterbalance, and a great deal more than\r\n",
      "counterbalance, the deterioration occasioned by tone and material, the\r\n",
      "whole edifice must be condemned, as incongruous with the spirit of the\r\n",
      "climate, and even with the character of its own gardens and approach. It\r\n",
      "remains, therefore, to notice the details themselves. Its form is simple\r\n",
      "to a degree; the roof generally quite flat, so as to leave the mass in\r\n",
      "the form of a parallelopiped, in general without wings or adjuncts of\r\n",
      "any sort. Villa Somma-Riva [Carlotta] is a good example of this general\r\n",
      "form and proportion, though it has an arched passage on each side, which\r\n",
      "takes away from its massiness. This excessive weight of effect would be\r\n",
      "injurious, if the building were set by itself; but, as it always forms\r\n",
      "the apex of a series of complicated terraces, it both relieves them and\r\n",
      "gains great dignity by its own unbroken simplicity of size. This general\r\n",
      "effect of form is not injured, when, as is often the case, an open\r\n",
      "passage is left in the center of the building, under tall and\r\n",
      "well-proportioned arches, supported by pilasters (never by columns).\r\n",
      "Villa Porro, Lago di Como, is a good example of this method. The arches\r\n",
      "hardly ever exceed three in number, and these are all of the same size,\r\n",
      "so that the crowns of the arches continue the horizontal lines of the\r\n",
      "rest of the building. Were the center one higher than the others, these\r\n",
      "lines would be interrupted, and a great deal of simplicity lost. The\r\n",
      "covered space under these arches is a delightful, shaded, and breezy\r\n",
      "retreat in the heat of the day; and the entrance doors usually open into\r\n",
      "it, so that a current of cool air is obtainable by throwing them open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "123. The building itself consists of three floors: we remember no\r\n",
      "instance of a greater number, and only one or two of fewer. It is, in\r\n",
      "general, crowned with a light balustrade, surmounted by statues at\r\n",
      "intervals. The windows of the uppermost floor are usually square, often\r\n",
      "without any architrave. Those of the principal floor are surrounded with\r\n",
      "broad architraves, but are frequently destitute of frieze or cornice.\r\n",
      "They have usually flat bands at the bottom, and their aperture is a\r\n",
      "double square. Their recess is very deep, so as not to let the sun fall\r\n",
      "far into the interior. The interval between them is very variable. In\r\n",
      "some of the villas of highest pretensions, such as those on the banks of\r\n",
      "the Brenta, that of Isola Bella, and others, which do not face the\r\n",
      "south, it is not much more than the breadth of the two architraves, so\r\n",
      "that the rooms within are filled with light. When this is the case, the\r\n",
      "windows have friezes and cornices. But, when the building fronts the\r\n",
      "south, the interval is often very great, as in the case of the Villa\r\n",
      "Porro. The ground-floor windows are frequently set in tall arches,\r\n",
      "supported on deeply engaged pilasters as in the Villa Somma-Riva. The\r\n",
      "door is not large, and never entered by high steps, as it generally\r\n",
      "opens on a terrace of considerable height, or on a wide landing-place at\r\n",
      "the head of a flight of fifty or sixty steps descending through the\r\n",
      "gardens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "124. Now, it will be observed, that, in these general forms, though\r\n",
      "there is no splendor, there is great dignity. The lines throughout are\r\n",
      "simple to a degree, entirely uninterrupted by decorations of any kind,\r\n",
      "so that the beauty of their proportions is left visible and evident. We\r\n",
      "shall see hereafter that ornament in Grecian architecture, while, when\r\n",
      "well managed, it always adds to its grace, invariably takes away from\r\n",
      "its majesty; and that these two attributes never can exist together in\r\n",
      "their highest degrees. By the utter absence of decoration, therefore,\r\n",
      "the Italian villa, possessing, as it usually does, great beauty of\r\n",
      "proportion, attains a degree of elevation of character, which impresses\r\n",
      "the mind in a manner which it finds difficult to account for by any\r\n",
      "consideration of its simple details or moderate size; while, at the same\r\n",
      "time, it lays so little claim to the attention, and is so subdued in its\r\n",
      "character, that it is enabled to occupy a conspicuous place in a\r\n",
      "landscape, without any appearance of intrusion. The glance of the\r\n",
      "beholder rises from the labyrinth of terrace and arbor beneath, almost\r\n",
      "weariedly; it meets, as it ascends, with a gradual increase of bright\r\n",
      "marble and simple light, and with a proportionate diminution of dark\r\n",
      "foliage and complicated shadow, till it rests finally on a piece of\r\n",
      "simple brilliancy, chaste and unpretending, yet singularly dignified;\r\n",
      "and does not find its color too harsh, because its form is so simple:\r\n",
      "for color of any kind is only injurious when the eye is too much\r\n",
      "attracted to it; and, when there is so much quietness of detail as to\r\n",
      "prevent this misfortune, the building will possess the cheerfulness,\r\n",
      "without losing the tranquillity, and will seem to have been erected, and\r\n",
      "to be inhabited, by a mind of that beautiful temperament wherein modesty\r\n",
      "tempers majesty, and gentleness mingles with rejoicing, which, above all\r\n",
      "others, is most suited to the essence, and most interwoven with the\r\n",
      "spirit, of the natural beauty whose peculiar power is invariably repose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "125. So much for its general character. Considered by principles of\r\n",
      "composition, it will also be found beautiful. Its prevailing lines are\r\n",
      "horizontal; and every artist knows that, where peaks of any kind are in\r\n",
      "sight, the lines above which they rise ought to be flat. It has not one\r\n",
      "acute angle in all its details, and very few intersections of verticals\r\n",
      "with horizontals; while all that do intersect seem useful as supporting\r\n",
      "the mass. The just application of the statues at the top is more\r\n",
      "doubtful, and is considered reprehensible by several high authorities,\r\n",
      "who, nevertheless, are inconsistent enough to let the balustrade pass\r\n",
      "uncalumniated, though it is objectionable on exactly the same grounds;\r\n",
      "for, if the statues suggest the inquiry of \"What are they doing there?\"\r\n",
      "the balustrade compels its beholder to ask, \"whom it keeps from tumbling\r\n",
      "over?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "126. The truth is, that the balustrade and statues derive their origin\r\n",
      "from a period when there was easy access to the roof of either temple or\r\n",
      "villa; (that there was such access is proved by a passage in the\r\n",
      "_Iphigenia Taurica_, line 113, where Orestes speaks of getting up to the\r\n",
      "triglyphs of a Doric temple as an easy matter;) and when the flat roofs\r\n",
      "were used, not, perhaps, as an evening promenade, as in Palestine, but\r\n",
      "as a place of observation, and occasionally of defense. They were\r\n",
      "composed of large flat slabs of stone ([Greek: keramos,[20]]) peculiarly\r\n",
      "adapted for walking, one or two of which, when taken up, left an opening\r\n",
      "of easy access into the house, as in Luke v. 19, and were perpetually\r\n",
      "used in Greece as missile weapons, in the event of a hostile attack or\r\n",
      "sedition in the city, by parties of old men, women, and children, who\r\n",
      "used, as a matter of course, to retire to the roof as a place of\r\n",
      "convenient defense. By such attacks from the roof with the [Greek:\r\n",
      "keramos] the Thebans were thrown into confusion in Platæa (_Thucydides_\r\n",
      "ii. 4.). So, also, we find the roof immediately resorted to in the case\r\n",
      "of the starving of Pausanias in the Temple of Minerva of the Brazen\r\n",
      "House, and in that of the massacre of the aristocratic party at Corcyra\r\n",
      "(_Thucydides_ iv. 48):--[Greek: Anabantes de epi to tegos tou oikêmatos,\r\n",

      "signifies earthen tiling, and sometimes earthenware in general, as in\r\n",
      "_Herodotus_ iii. 6 [where it is used of earthen jars of wine.] It\r\n",
      "appears that such tiling was frequently used in smaller edifices. The\r\n",
      "Greeks may have derived their flat roofs from Egypt. Herodotus mentions\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "127. Now, where the roof was thus a place of frequent resort, there\r\n",
      "could be no more useful decoration than a balustrade; nor one more\r\n",
      "appropriate or beautiful than occasional statues in attitudes of\r\n",
      "watchfulness, expectation, or observation: and even now, wherever the\r\n",
      "roof is flat, we have an idea of convenience and facility of access,\r\n",
      "which still renders the balustrade agreeable, and the statue beautiful,\r\n",
      "if well designed. It must not be a figure of perfect peace or repose;\r\n",
      "far less should it be in violent action: but it should be fixed in that\r\n",
      "quick, startled stillness, which is the result of intent observation or\r\n",
      "expectation, and which seems ready to start into motion every instant.\r\n",
      "Its height should be slightly colossal, as it is always to be seen\r\n",
      "against the sky; and its draperies should not be too heavy, as the eye\r\n",
      "will always expect them to be caught by the wind. We shall enter into\r\n",
      "this subject, however, more fully hereafter. We only wish at present to\r\n",
      "vindicate from the charge of impropriety one of the chief features of\r\n",
      "the Italian villa. Its white figures, always marble, remain entirely\r\n",
      "unsullied by the weather, and stand out with great majesty against the\r\n",

      "the simplicity, of the general form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "128. It seems then that, by its form and details, the villa of the Lago\r\n",
      "di Como attains so high a degree of elevation of character, as not only\r\n",
      "brings it into harmony of its _locus_, without any assistance from\r\n",
      "appearance of antiquity, but may, we think, permit it to dispense even\r\n",
      "with solidity of material, and appear in light summer stucco, instead of\r\n",
      "raising itself in imperishable marble. And this conclusion, which is\r\n",
      "merely theoretical, is verified by fact: for we remember no instance,\r\n",
      "except in cases where poverty had overpowered pretension, or decay had\r\n",
      "turned rejoicing into silence, in which the lightness of the material\r\n",
      "was offensive to the feelings; in all cases, it is agreeable to the eye.\r\n",
      "Where it is allowed to get worn, and discolored, and broken, it induces\r\n",
      "a wretched mockery of the dignified form which it preserves; but, as\r\n",
      "long as it is renewed at proper periods, and watched over by the eye of\r\n",
      "its inhabitant, it is an excellent and easily managed medium of effect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "129. With all the praise, however, which we have bestowed upon it, we do\r\n",
      "not say that the villa of the Larian Lake is perfection; indeed we\r\n",
      "cannot say so, until we have compared it with a few other instances,\r\n",
      "chiefly to be found in Italy, on whose soil we delay, as being the\r\n",
      "native country of the villa, properly so-called, and as ever yet being\r\n",
      "almost the only spot of Europe where any good specimens of it are to be\r\n",

      "Italy, where the Roman power secured tranquillity, and the Roman\r\n",

      "individuals, on whom, while it raised them to a position of great\r\n",
      "influence, and, in its later times, of wealth, it did not bestow the\r\n",
      "power of raising palaces or private fortresses. The villa was their\r\n",
      "peculiar habitation, their only resource, and a most agreeable one;\r\n",
      "because the multitudes of the kingdom being, for a long period, confined\r\n",
      "to a narrow territory, though ruling the world, rendered the population\r\n",

      "152. The original idea was given by the opening of the tangled glades in\r\n",
      "our most ancient forests. It is rather a curious circumstance that, in\r\n",
      "those woods whose decay has been most instrumental in forming the bog\r\n",
      "districts of Ireland, the trees have, in general, been planted in\r\n",
      "symmetrical rows, at distances of about twenty feet apart. If the\r\n",
      "arrangement of our later woods be not quite so formal, they at least\r\n",
      "present frequent openings, carpeted with green sward, and edged with\r\n",
      "various foliage, which the architect (for so may the designer of the\r\n",
      "avenue be entitled) should do little more than reduce to symmetry and\r\n",
      "place in position, preserving, as much as possible, the manner and the\r\n",
      "proportions of nature. The avenue, therefore, must not be too long. It\r\n",
      "is quite a mistake to suppose that there is sublimity in a monotonous\r\n",
      "length of line, unless indeed it be carried to an extent generally\r\n",
      "impossible, as in the case of the long walk at Windsor. From three to\r\n",
      "four hundred yards is a length which will display the elevation well,\r\n",
      "and will not become tiresome from continued monotony. The kind of tree\r\n",
      "must, of course, be regulated by circumstances; but the foliage must be\r\n",
      "unequally disposed, so as to let in passages of light across the path,\r\n",
      "and cause the motion of any object across it to change, like an\r\n",
      "undulating melody, from darkness to light. It should meet at the top, so\r\n",

      "without rigidity. The ground should be green, so that the sunlight may\r\n",
      "tell with force wherever it strikes. Now, this kind of rich and shadowy\r\n",
      "vista is found in its perfection only in England: it is an attribute of\r\n",
      "green country; it is associated with all our memories of forest freedom,\r\n",

      "characteristic, in the English villa: and be it remembered, that we are\r\n",
      "not speaking of the immense lines of foliage which guide the eye to some\r\n",
      "of our English palaces, for those are rather the adjuncts of the park\r\n",

      "eye, in the space of a hundred yards or so, to the gables of its gray\r\n",

      "following the right side of the Thames for about half a mile from\r\n",
      "Richmond Hill; though the house, which, in this case, is approached by a\r\n",
      "noble avenue, is much to be reprehended, as a bad mixture of imitation\r\n",
      "of the Italian with corrupt Elizabethan; though it is somewhat\r\n",

      "villa architecture which can be called English,--the Elizabethan, and\r\n",
      "its varieties,--a style fantastic in its details, and capable of being\r\n",
      "subjected to no rule, but, as we think, well adapted for the scenery in\r\n",
      "which it arose. We allude not only to the pure Elizabethan, but even to\r\n",
      "the strange mixtures of classical ornaments with Gothic forms, which we\r\n",
      "find prevailing in the sixteenth century. In the most simple form, we\r\n",
      "have a building extending round three sides of a court, and, in the\r\n",
      "larger halls, round several interior courts, terminating in sharply\r\n",

      "great deal of mixed, obstinate, and occasionally absurd originality. It\r\n",
      "has one or two graceful lines about it, and several harsh and cutting\r\n",

      "cottage-like in its prevailing forms, awakening no elevated ideas,\r\n",

      "185. Now, the matter-of-fact business-like activity of simple blue\r\n",
      "country has been already alluded to. This attribute renders in it a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "186. Its cleanness and freshness of color, admitting of little dampness\r\n",
      "or staining, firm in its consistence, not moldering like stone, and\r\n",
      "therefore inducing no conviction of antiquity or decay, presents rather\r\n",

      "temporary wealth, than of such solidity as is raised for the inheritance\r\n",
      "of unfluctuating power. It is thus admirably suited for that country\r\n",
      "where all is change, and all activity; where the working and\r\n",
      "money-making members of the community are perpetually succeeding and\r\n",
      "overpowering each other; enjoying, each in his turn, the reward of his\r\n",
      "industry; yielding up the field, the pasture, and the mine, to his\r\n",
      "successor, and leaving no more memory behind him, no farther evidence of\r\n",
      "his individual existence, than is left by a working bee, in the honey\r\n",
      "for which we thank his class, forgetting the individual. The simple blue\r\n",
      "country may, in fact, be considered the dining-table of the nation; from\r\n",
      "which it provides for its immediate necessities, at which it feels only\r\n",
      "its present existence, and in which it requires, not a piece of\r\n",
      "furniture adapted only to remind it of past refection, but a polished,\r\n",
      "clean, and convenient minister to its immediate wishes. No habitation,\r\n",
      "therefore, in this country, should look old: it should give an\r\n",
      "impression of present prosperity, of swift motion and high energy of\r\n",
      "life; too rapid in its successive operation to attain greatness, or\r\n",
      "allow of decay, in its works. This is the first cause which, in this\r\n",
      "country, renders brick allowable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "187. Again, wherever the soil breaks out in simple blue country, whether\r\n",
      "in the river shore, or the broken roadside bank, or the plowed field, in\r\n",
      "nine cases out of ten it is excessively warm in its color, being either\r\n",
      "gravel or clay, the black vegetable soil never remaining free of\r\n",
      "vegetation. The warm tone of these beds of soil is an admirable relief\r\n",
      "to the blue of the distances, which we have taken as the distinctive\r\n",
      "feature of the country, tending to produce the perfect light without\r\n",
      "which no landscape can be complete. Therefore the red of the brick is\r\n",
      "prevented from glaring upon the eye, by its falling in with similar\r\n",
      "colors in the ground, and contrasting finely with the general tone of\r\n",
      "the distance. This is another instance of the material which nature most\r\n",
      "readily furnishes being the right one. In almost all blue country, we\r\n",
      "have only to turn out a few spadefuls of loose soil, and we come to the\r\n",
      "bed of clay, which is the best material for the building; whereas we\r\n",
      "should have to travel hundreds of miles, or to dig thousands of feet, to\r\n",
      "get the stone which nature does not want, and therefore has not given.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "188. Another excellence in brick is its perfect air of English\r\n",
      "respectability. It is utterly impossible for an edifice altogether of\r\n",
      "brick to look affected or absurd: it may look rude, it may look vulgar,\r\n",
      "it may look disgusting, in a wrong place; but it cannot look foolish,\r\n",
      "for it is incapable of pretension. We may suppose its master a brute, or\r\n",
      "an ignoramus, but we can never suppose him a coxcomb: a bear he may be,\r\n",
      "a fop he cannot be; and, if we find him out of his place, we feel that\r\n",
      "it is owing to error, not to impudence; to self-ignorance, not to\r\n",
      "self-conceit; to the want, not the assumption of feeling. It is thus\r\n",
      "that brick is peculiarly English in its effect: for we are brutes in\r\n",
      "many things, and we are ignoramuses in many things, and we are destitute\r\n",
      "of feeling in many things, but we are _not_ coxcombs. It is only by the\r\n",
      "utmost effort, that some of our most highly gifted junior gentlemen can\r\n",
      "attain such distinction of title; and even then the honor sits ill upon\r\n",
      "them: they are but awkward coxcombs. Affectation[37] never was, and\r\n",
      "never will be, a part of English character; we have too much national\r\n",
      "pride, too much consciousness of our own dignity and power, too much\r\n",
      "established self-satisfaction, to allow us to become ridiculous by\r\n",
      "imitative efforts; and, as it is only by endeavoring to appear what he\r\n",
      "is not, that a man ever can become so, properly speaking, our\r\n",
      "true-witted Continental neighbors, who shrink from John Bull as a brute,\r\n",
      "never laugh at him as a fool. \"Il est bête, il n'est pas pourtant sot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Footnote 37: The nation, indeed, possesses one or two interesting\r\n",
      "individuals, whose affectation is, as we have seen, strikingly\r\n",
      "manifested in their lake villas: but every rule has its exceptions; and,\r\n",
      "even on these gifted personages, the affectation sits so very awkwardly,\r\n",
      "so like a velvet bonnet on a plowman's carroty hair, that it is\r\n",
      "evidently a late acquisition. Thus, one proprietor of land on\r\n",
      "Windermere, who has built unto himself a castellated mansion with round\r\n",
      "towers, and a Swiss cottage for a stable, has yet, with that admiration\r\n",
      "of the \"neat but not gaudy,\" which is commonly reported to have\r\n",
      "influenced the devil when he painted his tail pea-green, painted the\r\n",
      "rocks at the back of his house pink, that they may look clean. This is a\r\n",
      "little outcrop of English feeling in the midst of the assumed romance.]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "189. The brick house admirably corresponds with this part of English\r\n",
      "character; for, unable as it is to be beautiful, or graceful, or\r\n",
      "dignified, it is equally unable to be absurd. There is a proud\r\n",
      "independence about it, which seems conscious of its entire and perfect\r\n",
      "applicability to those uses for which it was built, and full of a\r\n",
      "good-natured intention to render every one who seeks shelter within its\r\n",
      "walls excessively comfortable; it therefore feels awkward in no company;\r\n",
      "and, wherever it intrudes its good-humored red face, stares plaster and\r\n",
      "marble out of countenance with an insensible audacity, which we drive\r\n",
      "out of such refined company, as we would a clown from a drawing-room,\r\n",
      "but which we nevertheless seek in its own place, as we would seek the\r\n",

      "in the main.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "190. Lastly. Brick is admirably adapted for the climate of England, and\r\n",
      "for the frequent manufacturing nuisances of English blue country: for\r\n",
      "the smoke, which makes marble look like charcoal, and stucco like mud,\r\n",
      "only renders brick less glaring in its color; and the inclement climate,\r\n",
      "which makes the composition front look as if its architect had been\r\n",
      "amusing himself by throwing buckets of green water down from the roof,\r\n",
      "and before which the granite base of Stirling Castle is moldering into\r\n",
      "sand as impotent as ever was ribbed by ripple, wreaks its rage in vain\r\n",
      "upon the bits of baked clay, leaving them strong, and dry, and\r\n",
      "stainless, warm and comfortable in their effect, even when neglect has\r\n",
      "permitted the moss and wall-flower to creep into their crannies, and\r\n",
      "mellow into something like beauty that which is always comfort. Damp,\r\n",
      "which fills many stones as it would a sponge, is defied by the brick;\r\n",
      "and the warmth of every gleam of sunshine is caught by it, and stored up\r\n",
      "for future expenditure; so that, both actually and in its effect, it is\r\n",
      "peculiarly suited for a climate whose changes are in general from bad to\r\n",
      "worse, and from worse to bad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "191. These then are the principal apologies which the brick\r\n",
      "dwelling-house has to offer for its ugliness. They will, however, only\r\n",
      "stand it in stead in the simple blue country; and, even there, only when\r\n",
      "the following points are observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First. The brick should neither be of the white, nor the very dark red,\r\n",
      "kind. The white is worse than useless as a color: its cold, raw, sandy\r\n",
      "neutral has neither warmth enough to relieve, nor gray enough to\r\n",
      "harmonize with, any natural tones; it does not please the eye by warmth,\r\n",
      "in shade; it hurts it, by dry heat in sun; it has none of the advantages\r\n",
      "of effect which brick may have, to compensate for the vulgarity which it\r\n",
      "must have, and is altogether to be abhorred. The very bright red, again,\r\n",
      "is one of the ugliest warm colors that art ever stumbled upon: it is\r\n",
      "never mellowed by damps or anything else, and spoils everything near it\r\n",
      "by its intolerable and inevitable glare. The moderately dark brick, of a\r\n",
      "neutral red, is to be chosen, and this, after a year or two, will be\r\n",
      "farther softened in its color by atmospheric influence, and will possess\r\n",
      "all the advantages we have enumerated. It is almost unnecessary to point\r\n",
      "out its fitness for a damp situation, not only as the best material for\r\n",
      "securing the comfort of the inhabitant, but because it will the sooner\r\n",
      "contract a certain degree of softness of tone, occasioned by microscopic\r\n",
      "vegetation, which will leave no more brick-red than is agreeable to the\r\n",
      "feelings where the atmosphere is chill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "192. Secondly. Even this kind of red is a very powerful color; and as,\r\n",
      "in combination with the other primitive colors, very little of it will\r\n",
      "complete the light, so, very little will answer every purpose in\r\n",
      "landscape composition, and every addition, above that little, will be\r\n",
      "disagreeable. Brick, therefore, never should be used in large groups of\r\n",
      "buildings, where those groups are to form part of landscape scenery: two\r\n",
      "or three houses, partly shaded with trees, are all that can be admitted\r\n",
      "at once. There is no object more villainously destructive of natural\r\n",
      "beauty, than a large town, of very red brick, with very scarlet tiling,\r\n",
      "very tall chimneys, and very few trees; while there are few objects that\r\n",
      "harmonize more agreeably with the feeling of English ordinary landscape,\r\n",
      "than the large, old, solitary, brick manor house, with its group of dark\r\n",
      "cedars on the lawn in front, and the tall wrought-iron gates opening\r\n",
      "down the avenue of approach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "193. Thirdly. No stone quoining, or presence of any contrasting color,\r\n",
      "should be admitted. Quoins in general (though, by the by, they are\r\n",
      "prettily managed in the old Tolbooth of Glasgow, and some other antique\r\n",
      "buildings in Scotland), are only excusable as giving an appearance of\r\n",
      "strength; while their zigzag monotony, when rendered conspicuous by\r\n",
      "difference of color, is altogether detestable. White cornices, niches,\r\n",
      "and the other superfluous introductions in stone and plaster, which some\r\n",
      "architects seem to think ornamental, only mock what they cannot mend,\r\n",
      "take away the whole expression of the edifice, render the brick-red\r\n",
      "glaring and harsh, and become themselves ridiculous in isolation.\r\n",
      "Besides, as a general principle, contrasts of extensive color are to be\r\n",
      "avoided in all buildings, and especially in positive and unmanageable\r\n",
      "tints. It is difficult to imagine whence the custom of putting stone\r\n",
      "ornaments into brick buildings could have arisen; unless it be an\r\n",
      "imitation of the Italian custom of mixing marble with stucco, which\r\n",
      "affords it no sanction, as the marble is only distinguishable from the\r\n",
      "general material by the sharpness of the carved edges. The Dutch seem to\r\n",
      "have been the originators of the custom; and, by the by, if we remember\r\n",
      "right, in one of the very finest pieces of coloring now extant, a\r\n",
      "landscape by Rubens (in the gallery at Munich, we think), the artist\r\n",
      "seems to have sanctioned the barbarism, by introducing a brick edifice,\r\n",
      "with white stone quoining. But the truth is that he selected the\r\n",
      "subject, partly under the influence of domestic feelings, the place\r\n",
      "being, as it is thought, his own habitation, and partly as a piece of\r\n",
      "practice, presenting such excessive difficulties of color, as he, the\r\n",
      "lord of color, who alone could overcome them, would peculiarly delight\r\n",
      "in overcoming; and the harmony with which he has combined tints of the\r\n",
      "most daring force, and sharpest apparent contrast, in the edgy building,\r\n",
      "and opposed them to an uninteresting distance of excessive azure (simple\r\n",
      "blue country, observe), is one of the chief wonders of the painting: so\r\n",
      "that this masterpiece can no more furnish an apology for the continuance\r\n",
      "of a practice which, though it gives some liveliness of character to the\r\n",
      "warehouses of Amsterdam, is fit only for a place whose foundations are\r\n",
      "mud, and whose inhabitants are partially animated cheeses,--than\r\n",
      "Caravaggio's custom of painting blackguards should introduce an ambition\r\n",
      "among mankind in general of becoming fit subjects for his pencil. We\r\n",
      "shall have occasion again to allude to this subject, in speaking of\r\n",
      "Dutch street effects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "194. Fourthly. It will generally be found to agree best with the\r\n",
      "business-like air of the blue country, if the house be excessively\r\n",

      "character? Very nearly--the Greek: for these attributes, common to all\r\n",

      "by every climate. In England they are all low in their tone; but as we\r\n",

      "greater and more universal energy of the beautiful permits its features\r\n",

      "agreeable in all blue country: but there must be warmth in it, and a\r\n",
      "great deal too,--gray being comfortless and useless with a cold\r\n",

      "should be kept out of sight as much as possible; and therefore the one\r\n",
      "very flat, and the other very plain. We ought to revive the Greek custom\r\n",
      "of roofing with thin slabs of coarse marble, cut into the form of tiles.\r\n",
      "However, where the architect finds he has a very cool distance, and few\r\n",
      "trees about the building, and where it stands so high as to preclude the\r\n",
      "possibility of its being looked down upon, he will, if he be courageous,\r\n",
      "use a very flat roof of the dark Italian tile. The eaves, which are all\r\n",
      "that should be seen, will be peculiarly graceful; and the sharp contrast\r\n",
      "of color (for this tiling can only be admitted with white walls) may be\r\n",
      "altogether avoided, by letting them cast a strong shadow, and by running\r\n",
      "the walls up into a range of low garret windows, to break the horizontal\r\n",
      "line of the roof. He will thus obtain a bit of very strong color, which\r\n",
      "will impart a general glow of cheerfulness to the building, and which,\r\n",
      "if he manages it rightly, will not be glaring nor intrusive. It is to\r\n",
      "be observed, however, that he can only do this with villas of the most\r\n",
      "humble order, and that he will seldom find his employer possessed of so\r\n",
      "much common sense as to put up with a tile roof. When this is the case,\r\n",
      "the flat slabs of the upper limestone (ragstone) are usually better than\r\n",
      "slate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "definition. Every tint is raw which is perfectly opaque, and has not all\r\n",
      "the three primitive colors in its composition. Thus, black is always\r\n",
      "raw, because it has no color; white never, because it has all colors. No\r\n",
      "tint can be raw which is not opaque; and opacity may be taken away,\r\n",

      "this. Brick, when first fired, is always raw; but when it has been a\r\n",
      "little weathered, it acquires a slight blue tint, assisted by the gray\r\n",
      "of the mortar: incipient vegetation affords it the yellow. It thus\r\n",
      "obtains an admixture of the three colors, and is raw no longer. An old\r\n",

      "necessity have folded shades: those shades are of a rich gray; no gray\r\n",
      "can exist without yellow and blue. We have then three colors, and no\r\n",
      "rawness. It must be observed however, that when any one of the colors is\r\n",
      "given in so slight a degree that it can be overpowered by certain\r\n",
      "effects of light, the united color, when opaque, will be raw. Thus many\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "204. The woody, or green country, which is next in order, was spoken of\r\n",
      "before, and was shown to be especially our own. The Elizabethan was\r\n",
      "pointed out as the style peculiarly belonging to it; and farther\r\n",
      "criticism of that style was deferred until we came to the consideration\r\n",

      "therefore at present only to offer a few remarks on the principles to be\r\n",
      "observed in the erection of Elizabethan villas at the present day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "205. First. The building must be either quite chaste, or excessively\r\n",
      "rich in decoration. Every inch of ornament short of a certain quantity\r\n",
      "will render the whole effect poor and ridiculous; while the pure\r\n",
      "perpendicular lines of this architecture will always look well if left\r\n",
      "entirely alone. The architect therefore, when limited as to expense,\r\n",
      "should content himself with making his oriels project boldly, channeling\r\n",
      "their mullions richly, and, in general, rendering his vertical lines\r\n",
      "delicate and beautiful in their workmanship; but, if his estimate be\r\n",
      "unlimited, he should lay on his ornament richly, taking care never to\r\n",
      "confuse the eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those parts to which, of necessity, observation is especially directed,\r\n",
      "must be finished so as to bear a close scrutiny, that the eye may rest\r\n",
      "on them with satisfaction: but their finish must not be of a character\r\n",
      "which would have attracted the eye by itself, without being placed in a\r\n",
      "conspicuous situation; for, if it were, the united attraction of form\r\n",
      "and detail would confine the contemplation altogether to the parts so\r\n",
      "distinguished, and render it impossible for the mind to receive any\r\n",
      "impression of general effect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Consequently, the parts that project, and are to bear a strong light,\r\n",
      "must be chiseled with infinite delicacy; so that the ornament, though it\r\n",
      "would have remained unobserved had the eye not been guided to it, when\r\n",
      "observed, may be of distinguished beauty and power; but those parts\r\n",
      "which are to be flat and in shade should be marked with great sharpness\r\n",
      "and boldness, that the impression may be equalized.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When, for instance, we have to do with oriels, to which attention is\r\n",
      "immediately attracted by their projection, we may run wreaths of the\r\n",
      "finest flower-work up the mullions, charge the terminations with\r\n",
      "shields, and quarter them richly; but we must join the window to the\r\n",
      "wall, where its shadow falls, by means of more deep and decided\r\n",
      "decoration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "206. Secondly. In the choice and design of his ornaments, the architect\r\n",
      "should endeavor to be grotesque rather than graceful (though little bits\r\n",
      "of soft flower-work here and there will relieve the eye): but he must\r\n",
      "not imagine he can be grotesque by carving faces with holes for eyes and\r\n",
      "knobs for noses; on the contrary, whenever he mimics grotesque life,\r\n",
      "there should be wit and humor in every feature, fun and frolic in every\r\n",
      "attitude; every distortion should be anatomical, and every monster a\r\n",
      "studied combination. This is a question, however, relating more nearly\r\n",
      "to Gothic architecture and therefore we shall not enter into it at\r\n",
      "present.[41]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Footnote 41: [See _Stones of Venice_, vol. III. chap. iii.]]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "207. Thirdly. The gables must on no account be jagged into a succession\r\n",
      "of right angles, as if people were to be perpetually engaged in trotting\r\n",
      "up one side and down the other. This custom, though sanctioned by\r\n",
      "authority, has very little apology to offer for itself, based on any\r\n",
      "principle of composition. In street effect indeed it is occasionally\r\n",
      "useful; and where the verticals below are unbroken by ornament, may be\r\n",
      "used even in the detached Elizabethan, but not when decoration has been\r\n",
      "permitted below. They should then be carried up in curved lines,\r\n",
      "alternating with two angles, or three at the most, without pinnacles or\r\n",
      "hipknobs. A hollow parapet is far better than a battlement, in the\r\n",
      "intermediate spaces; the latter indeed is never allowable, except when\r\n",
      "the building has some appearance of being intended for defense, and\r\n",
      "therefore is generally barbarous in the villa; while the parapet admits\r\n",
      "of great variety of effect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "208. Lastly. Though the grotesque of Elizabethan architecture is\r\n",
      "adapted for wood country, the grotesque of the clipped garden, which\r\n",
      "frequently accompanies it, is not. The custom of clipping trees into\r\n",
      "fantastic forms is always to be reprehended: first, because it never can\r\n",
      "produce the true grotesque, for the material is not passive, and,\r\n",
      "therefore, a perpetual sense of restraint is induced, while the great\r\n",
      "principle of the grotesque is action; again, because we have a distinct\r\n",
      "perception of two natures, the one neutralizing the other; for the\r\n",
      "vegetable organization is too palpable to let the animal form suggest\r\n",
      "its true idea; again, because the great beauty of all foliage is the\r\n",
      "energy of life and action, of which it loses the appearance by formal\r\n",
      "clipping; and again, because the hands of the gardener will never\r\n",
      "produce anything really spirited or graceful. Much, however, need not be\r\n",
      "said on this subject; for the taste of the public does not now prompt\r\n",
      "them to such fettering of fair freedom, and we should be as sorry to see\r\n",
      "the characteristic vestiges of it, which still remain in a few gardens,\r\n",
      "lost altogether, as to see the thing again becoming common.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "209. The garden of the Elizabethan villa, then, should be laid out with\r\n",
      "a few simple terraces near the house, so as to unite it well with the\r\n",
      "ground; lines of balustrade along the edges, guided away into the\r\n",
      "foliage of the taller trees of the garden, with the shadows falling at\r\n",
      "intervals. The balusters should be square rather than round, with the\r\n",
      "angles outward; and if the balustrade looks unfinished at the corners,\r\n",

      "the individuals brought before us is far stronger than it could\r\n",
      "otherwise have been, and our sympathies are more forcibly awakened;\r\n",
      "while, had the contrast been wanting, the impression of pain would have\r\n",
      "come over into ourselves, our selfish feeling, instead of our sympathy,\r\n",
      "would have been awakened; the conception of the grief of others\r\n",
      "diminished; and the tragedy would have made us very uncomfortable, but\r\n",
      "never have melted us to tears or excited us to indignation. When he,\r\n",
      "whose merry and satirical laugh rung in our ears the moment before,\r\n",
      "faints before us, with \"a plague o' both your houses, they have made\r\n",
      "worms' meat of me,\" the acuteness of our feeling is excessive: but, had\r\n",
      "we not heard the laugh before, there would have been a dull weight of\r\n",
      "melancholy impression, which would have been painful, not affecting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "234. Hence, we see the grand importance of the choice of our means of\r\n",
      "enhancing effect, and we derive the simple rule for that choice, namely,\r\n",
      "that, when we wish to increase abstract impression, or to call upon the\r\n",
      "sympathy of the spectator, we are to use contrast; but, when we wish to\r\n",
      "extend the operation of the impression, or to awaken the selfish\r\n",
      "feelings, we are to use assimilation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This rule, however, becomes complicated, where the feature of contrast\r\n",
      "is not altogether passive; that is, where we wish to give a conception\r\n",
      "of any qualities inherent in that feature, as well as in what it\r\n",
      "relieves; and, besides, it is not always easy to know whether it will be\r\n",
      "best to increase the abstract idea, or its operation. In most cases,\r\n",
      "energy, the degree of influence, is beauty; and, in many, the duration\r\n",
      "of influence is monotony. In others, duration is sublimity, and energy\r\n",
      "painful: in a few, energy and duration are attainable and delightful\r\n",
      "together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "235. It is impossible to give rules for judgment in every case; but the\r\n",
      "following points must always be observed:--First, when we use contrast,\r\n",
      "it must be natural and likely to occur. Thus the contrast in tragedy is\r\n",
      "the natural consequence of the character of human existence; it is what\r\n",
      "we see and feel every day of our lives. When a contrast is unnatural, it\r\n",
      "destroys the effect it should enhance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Canning called on a French refugee in 1794. The conversation naturally\r\n",
      "turned on the execution of the Queen, then a recent event. Overcome by\r\n",
      "his feelings, the Parisian threw himself upon the ground, exclaiming, in\r\n",
      "an agony of tears, \"La bonne reine! la pauvre reine!\" Presently he\r\n",
      "sprang up, exclaiming, \"Cependant, Monsieur, il faut vous faire voir mon\r\n",
      "petit chien danser.\" This contrast, though natural in a Parisian, was\r\n",
      "unnatural in the nature of things, and therefore injurious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "236. Secondly, when the general influence, instead of being external, is\r\n",
      "an attribute or energy of the thing itself, so as to bestow on it a\r\n",
      "permanent character, the contrast which is obtained by the absence of\r\n",
      "that character is injurious, and becomes what is called an interruption\r\n",
      "of the unity. Thus, the raw and colorless tone of the Swiss cottage,\r\n",
      "noticed in § 42, is an injurious contrast to the richness of the\r\n",
      "landscape, which is an inherent and necessary energy in surrounding\r\n",
      "objects. So, the character of Italian landscape is curvilinear;\r\n",
      "therefore, the outline of the buildings entering into its composition\r\n",
      "must be arranged on curvilinear principles, as investigated in § 144.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "237. Thirdly. But, if the pervading character can be obtained in the\r\n",
      "single object by different means, the contrast will be delightful. Thus,\r\n",
      "the elevation of character which the hill districts of Italy possess by\r\n",
      "the magnificence of their forms, is transmitted to the villa by its\r\n",
      "dignity of detail and simplicity of outline; and the rectangular\r\n",
      "interruption to the curve of picturesque blue country, partaking of the\r\n",
      "nature of that which it interrupts, is a contrast giving relief and\r\n",
      "interest, while any Elizabethan acute angles, on the contrary, would\r\n",
      "have been a contrast obtained by the absence of the pervading energy of\r\n",
      "the universal curvilinear character, and therefore improper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "238. Fourthly, when the general energy, instead of pervading\r\n",
      "simultaneously the multitude of objects, as with one spirit, is\r\n",
      "independently possessed and manifested by every individual object, the\r\n",
      "result is repetition, not unity; and contrast is not merely agreeable,\r\n",
      "but necessary. Thus, a number of objects, forming the line of beauty, is\r\n",
      "pervaded by one simple energy; but if that energy is separately\r\n",
      "manifested in each, the result is painful monotony. Parallel right\r\n",
      "lines, without grouping, are always liable to this objection; and,\r\n",
      "therefore, a distant view of a flat country is never beautiful unless\r\n",
      "its horizontals are lost in richness of vegetation, as in Lombardy, or\r\n",
      "broken with masses of forest, or with distant hills. If none of these\r\n",
      "interruptions take place, there is immediate monotony, and no\r\n",
      "introduction can be more delightful than such a tower in the distance as\r\n",
      "Strasburg, or, indeed, than any architectural combination of verticals.\r\n",
      "Peterborough is a beautiful instance of such an adaptation. It is\r\n",
      "always, then, to be remembered that repetition is not assimilation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "239. Fifthly, when any attribute is necessarily beautiful, that is,\r\n",
      "beautiful in every place and circumstance, we need hardly say that the\r\n",
      "contrast consisting in its absence is painful. It is only when beauty is\r\n",
      "local or accidental that opposition may be employed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sixthly. The _edge_ of all contrasts, so to speak, should be as soft as\r\n",
      "is consistent with decisive effect. We mean, that a gradual change is\r\n",
      "better than instantaneous transfiguration; for, though always less\r\n",
      "effective, it is more agreeable. But this must be left very much to the\r\n",
      "judgment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seventhly. We must be very careful in ascertaining whether any given\r\n",
      "contrast is obtained by freedom from external, or absence of internal,\r\n",
      "energy, for it is often a difficult point to decide. Thus, the peace of\r\n",
      "the Alpine valley might, at first, seem to be a contrast caused by the\r\n",
      "want of the character of strength and sublimity manifested in the hills;\r\n",
      "but it is really caused by the freedom from the general and external\r\n",
      "influence of violence and desolation.\r\n",

      "single exception, and of particular importance in painting and\r\n",
      "architecture.[53] It will sometimes be found that one rule comes in the\r\n",
      "way of another; in which case, the most important is, of course, to be\r\n",
      "obeyed; but, in general, they will afford us an easy means of arriving\r\n",
      "at certain results, when, before, our conjectures must have been vague\r\n",
      "and unsatisfactory.\r\n",

      "cheerfulness of effect. It should not look like stone, as the cottage\r\n",
      "should, but should tell as a building on the mind as well as the eye.\r\n",
      "White, therefore, is frequently allowable in small quantities,\r\n",
      "particularly on the border of a large and softly shored lake, like\r\n",
      "Windermere and the foot of Loch Lomond; but cream-color, and\r\n",

      "trees about his house and close to it (which, if it be white, he must\r\n",
      "have, to prevent glare), such a gray is the only color which will be\r\n",

      "shadows would make it far too conspicuous, and we should get only\r\n",
      "tawdriness. The simple forms may be executed in anything that will stand\r\n",
      "wet; and the roof, in all cases, should be of the coarse slate of the\r\n",
      "country, as rudely put on as possible. They must be kept clear of moss\r\n",
      "and conspicuous vegetation, or there will be an improper appearance of\r\n",
      "decay; but the more lichenous the better, and the rougher the slate the\r\n",
      "sooner it is colored. If the color is to be gray, we may use the gray\r\n",
      "primitive limestone, which is not ragged on the edges, without preparing\r\n",
      "the blocks too smoothly; or the more compact and pale-colored slate,\r\n",
      "which is frequently done in Westmoreland; and execute the ornaments in\r\n",
      "any very coarse dark marble. Greenstone is an excellent rock, and has a\r\n",
      "fine surface, but it is unmanageable. The grayer granites may often be\r\n",
      "used with good effect, as well as the coarse porphyries, when the gray\r\n",
      "is to be particularly warm. An outward surface of a loose block may be\r\n",
      "often turned to good account in turning an angle; as the colors which it\r\n",
      "has contracted by its natural exposure will remain on it without\r\n",
      "inducing damp. It is always to be remembered, that he who prefers\r\n",
      "neatness to beauty, and who would have sharp angles and clean surfaces,\r\n",
      "in preference to curved outlines and lichenous color, has no business to\r\n",

      "edifice itself. Of the mode of uniting it with the near features of\r\n",
      "foliage and ground, it would be utterly useless to speak: it is a\r\n",
      "question of infinite variety, and involving the whole theory of\r\n",
      "composition, so that it would take up volumes to develop principles\r\n",
      "sufficient to guide us to the result which the feeling of the practiced\r\n",
      "eye would arrive at in a moment. The inequalities of the ground, the\r\n",
      "character and color of those inequalities, the nature of the air, the\r\n",
      "exposure, and the consequent fall of the light, the quantity and form of\r\n",
      "near and distant foliage, all have their effect on the design, and\r\n",
      "should have their influence on the designer, inducing, as they do, a\r\n",
      "perfect change of circumstance in every locality. Only one general rule\r\n",
      "can be given, and that we repeat. The house must _not_ be a noun\r\n",
      "substantive, it must not stand by itself, it must be part and parcel of\r\n",
      "a proportioned whole: it must not even be seen all at once; and he who\r\n",
      "sees one end should feel that, from the given data, he can arrive at no\r\n",
      "conclusion respecting the other, yet be impressed with a feeling of a\r\n",
      "universal energy, pervading with its beauty of unanimity all life and\r\n",
